# Excel Curriculum Replanning

This document outlines a revised, simplified curriculum for the Excel-focused lessons in each unit. The goal is to break down complex topics into a sequence of 4 lessons, each focusing on 1-2 core skills that can be demonstrated by a teacher and practiced by students in approximately 30-35 minutes.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **One Concept at a Time:** Each lesson introduces only one or two new, closely related skills.
2.  **Repetition is Key:** Skills from earlier lessons are repeated and used in later lessons.
3.  **Data is Provided:** Students will work from pre-made templates with raw data. No time will be spent on manual data entry.
4.  **Build to a Goal:** The four lessons in each unit build upon each other to create a single, coherent final product.

## Unit 1: Smart Ledger Launch

**Core Accounting Goal:** Build a self-auditing ledger and trial balance.

### Lesson 4: Intro to Excel Tables
*   **Skills:**
    1.  Formatting a range as an Excel Table.
    2.  Using basic `SUM` formulas with structured references (e.g., `=SUM(Table1[Debit])`).
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A single sheet with a simple, unformatted list of 10-15 journal entries (Date, Account, Debit, Credit).
*   **Lesson Outcome:** Students will have a professionally formatted Excel Table. At the bottom, they will have cells that sum the total debits and total credits for the entire table.

### Lesson 5: Aggregating with `SUMIF`
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) Excel Tables.
    2.  Writing a `SUMIF` formula to aggregate data based on a condition.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** Two sheets.
    1.  `Journal`: The completed table of transactions from the previous lesson.
    2.  `TrialBalance`: A list of unique account names with empty Debit and Credit columns.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** Students will have a `TrialBalance` sheet that uses `SUMIF` to automatically pull and sum the total debits and credits for each account from the `Journal` sheet.

### Lesson 6: Visual Error Checking
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) `SUMIF` and Tables.
    2.  Applying Conditional Formatting to highlight cells based on a rule.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** The completed workbook from Lesson 5. We will add a "Check" column to the `TrialBalance` sheet.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** The `TrialBalance` sheet will have a "Check" column (`=Debit-Credit`). Conditional formatting will turn the cell green if the result is 0 and red if it is not, giving an instant visual cue for unbalanced entries.

### Lesson 7: Final Ledger Validation
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) Conditional Formatting and `SUMIF`.
    2.  Using the `ABS` function for a final balance check.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** The completed workbook from Lesson 6.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** At the bottom of the `TrialBalance` sheet, students will build a final validation check. It will sum the total debits and credits for the whole trial balance and use the formula `=ABS(TotalDebits - TotalCredits)` to show the absolute difference. A label will clearly state if the ledger is balanced or not.

## Unit 2: Month-End Wizard

**Core Accounting Goal:** Understand and automate month-end adjustments like accruals, deferrals, and depreciation.

### Lesson 4: Organizing with Named Ranges
*   **Skills:**
    1.  Defining Named Ranges for key cells.
    2.  Using Named Ranges in simple formulas.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A simple, one-sheet financial summary with labels like "Total Revenue," "Total Expenses," and "Net Income," each with a hard-coded value next to it.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** Students will have named key cells (e.g., `Total_Revenue`) and use those names in the `Net_Income` formula (e.g., `=Total_Revenue-Total_Expenses`).

### Lesson 5: Basic Adjusting Entries
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) Using basic formulas (`SUM`, division).
    2.  Calculating a simple straight-line depreciation (`SLN` function).
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A sheet with a small list of fixed assets (e.g., "Company Van," "Laptop") with their cost, salvage value, and useful life.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** Students will create a simple depreciation schedule that calculates the annual depreciation for each asset using the `SLN` function.

### Lesson 6: Recording a Simple Macro
*   **Skills:**
    1.  Using the Macro Recorder to record a set of formatting steps.
    2.  Assigning a macro to a button.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** An unformatted block of data (e.g., a simple report with a title, headers, and numbers).
*   **Lesson Outcome:** Students will have a button on their worksheet that, when clicked, automatically applies a consistent set of formatting (e.g., bolding the title, adding borders to headers, formatting numbers as currency) to the data block.

### Lesson 7: Linking Adjustments to a Report
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) Named Ranges.
    2.  Simple cell linking (`=`) across different worksheets.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A two-sheet workbook.
    1.  `Adjustments`: The depreciation schedule from Lesson 5.
    2.  `Report`: A simple financial report that needs to include "Depreciation Expense."
*   **Lesson Outcome:** The "Depreciation Expense" line on the `Report` sheet will be dynamically linked to the total depreciation calculated on the `Adjustments` sheet, ensuring the report updates automatically.

    1.  (Review) Linking cells across sheets.
    2.  Ensuring the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) balances.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** The workbook from Lesson 4, plus the trial balance data for asset, liability, and equity accounts.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** A Balance Sheet that correctly categorizes accounts and links Net Income from the Income Statement to the Retained Earnings section in Equity. A check formula (`=TotalAssets - (TotalLiabilities + TotalEquity)`) will validate the balance.

### Lesson 6: Intro to `XLOOKUP`
*   **Skills:**
    1.  Using `XLOOKUP` to find and retrieve data from a list.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A simple two-sheet workbook.

    2.  `Payroll`: A sheet where a user can type in an employee ID and have their name and pay rate appear automatically.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** A simple payroll lookup tool where entering an ID in one cell uses `XLOOKUP` to populate the employee's details in adjacent cells.

### Lesson 7: Linking the Cash Flow Statement
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) Cross-sheet linking and basic formulas.
    2.  Understanding the logic of an indirect cash flow statement.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** The completed workbook with the Income Statement and Balance Sheet.

*   **Lesson Outcome:** On the `Payroll` sheet, the Gross Pay will be used in an `XLOOKUP` formula to find the correct tax rate from the `TaxTables` sheet.

### Lesson 6: Net Pay Calculation
*   **Skills:**
    1.  (Review) Basic formulas.
    2.  Combining multiple formulas to create a multi-step calculation.

    2.  Using the `DDB` (Double-Declining Balance) depreciation function.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A list of fixed assets with their cost, salvage value, and useful life.
*   **Lesson Outcome:** A depreciation schedule showing the annual depreciation expense for each asset calculated using both the SLN and DDB methods side-by-side.

### Lesson 5: FIFO Inventory Method

    2.  Linking assumption cells to the main model.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** A two-sheet workbook.
    1.  `Assumptions`: A clean input sheet for key business drivers (e.g., Monthly Growth Rate, Price per Unit, Cost per Unit).
    2.  `Model`: A monthly forecast (e.g., an Income Statement).
*   **Lesson Outcome:** A financial model where the calculations are driven by the input cells on the `Assumptions` sheet. Changing the "Growth Rate" on the assumptions sheet will automatically update the entire forecast.

### Lesson 5: Scenario Building with `IF`

    1.  (Review) `IF` statements.
    2.  Creating "Best Case," "Base Case," and "Worst Case" scenarios.
*   **Demo Data Structure:** The model from the previous lesson. We will add a single input cell for "Scenario Selection" (e.g., a user can type 1, 2, or 3).
*   **Lesson Outcome:** The model's key drivers (like growth rate) will be driven by an `IF` statement that looks at the scenario selection cell, allowing the entire forecast to toggle between different scenarios.

### Lesson 6: Auditing Formulas
