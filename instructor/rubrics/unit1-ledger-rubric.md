# Assessment Rubric: Smart Ledger Launch

This comprehensive rubric is designed to assess student performance on the Unit 1 Smart Ledger Launch project. The rubric aligns with the learning objectives and provides clear criteria for evaluating both the technical accuracy of the ledger and the effectiveness of the investor pitch.

## Project Overview

Students create a self-auditing ledger in Excel that would convince a potential angel investor they keep "clean books" from day 1. The project culminates in a 4-minute pitch and live demo to a panel of PTA members with finance backgrounds.

## Rubric Structure

The rubric is divided into four main criteria areas:
1. **Accuracy** (45%)
2. **Functionality** (25%)
3. **User Documentation** (15%)
4. **Pitch Clarity & Persuasion** (15%)

## Detailed Rubric

### 1. Accuracy (45%)

| Level | Description | Points |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Exemplary**<br>(90-100%) | All transactions are correctly posted with proper debits and credits; accounting equation remains perfectly balanced; trial balance reconciles completely; account classifications are accurate and consistent | 40-45 |
| **Proficient**<br>(80-89%) | Most transactions are correctly posted with minor errors; accounting equation is balanced; trial balance reconciles with minimal discrepancies; account classifications are mostly accurate | 36-39 |
| **Developing**<br>(70-79%) | Several transactions have errors in debits or credits; accounting equation shows minor imbalances; trial balance has noticeable discrepancies; some account classifications are incorrect | 31-35 |
| **Beginning**<br>(60-69%) | Multiple transactions have significant errors; accounting equation is frequently unbalanced; trial balance has major discrepancies; many account classifications are incorrect | 27-30 |
| **Incomplete**<br>(<60%) | Most transactions are incorrectly recorded; accounting equation is fundamentally unbalanced; trial balance does not reconcile; account classifications show major conceptual misunderstandings | 0-26 |

**Key Elements to Assess:**
- Proper application of debit/credit rules
- Balanced accounting equation throughout
- Accurate trial balance
- Correct account classifications

| **Beginning**<br>(60-69%) | SUMIF formulas have significant errors; trial balance auto-check is unreliable; red-flag rules are minimally functional; Excel Table is poorly configured with few structured references | 15-16 |
| **Incomplete**<br>(<60%) | SUMIF formulas are missing or non-functional; trial balance auto-check does not work; red-flag rules are missing or non-functional; Excel Table is missing or improperly used | 0-14 |

**Key Elements to Assess:**
- SUMIF implementation for account totals

| **Proficient**<br>(80-89%) | Good documentation with clear instructions, adequate comments, and labeled sections; mostly consistent naming conventions; good organization; includes basic user guidance; most formulas are documented | 12 |
| **Developing**<br>(70-79%) | Basic documentation with some instructions, limited comments, and partially labeled sections; inconsistent naming conventions; adequate organization; minimal user guidance; some formulas are documented | 10-11 |
| **Beginning**<br>(60-69%) | Minimal documentation with few instructions, sparse comments, and poorly labeled sections; inconsistent naming conventions; disorganized structure; little to no user guidance; few formulas are documented | 9 |
| **Incomplete**<br>(<60%) | Documentation is missing or severely inadequate; naming conventions are absent or confusing; disorganized structure; no user guidance; formulas are undocumented | 0-8 |

**Key Elements to Assess:**
- Clarity of instructions and comments
- Consistency of naming conventions
- Organization and labeling of sections
- Presence of user guidance or legend
- Documentation of formulas and calculations

### 4. Pitch Clarity & Persuasion (15%)

| Level | Description | Points |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Exemplary**<br>(90-100%) | Exceptional 4-minute pitch with compelling narrative; addresses investor concerns comprehensively; demonstrates all key features effectively; excellent live demo; responds to questions with confidence and expertise; professional presentation style | 13-15 |
| **Proficient**<br>(80-89%) | Strong 4-minute pitch with clear narrative; addresses most investor concerns; demonstrates key features effectively; good live demo; responds to questions adequately; professional presentation style | 12 |
| **Developing**<br>(70-79%) | Adequate 4-minute pitch with basic narrative; addresses some investor concerns; demonstrates some features; adequate live demo; responds to some questions; acceptable presentation style | 10-11 |
| **Beginning**<br>(60-69%) | Weak pitch exceeding or falling short of 4 minutes; unclear narrative; addresses few investor concerns; demonstrates few features; poor live demo; struggles to respond to questions; unprofessional presentation style | 9 |
| **Incomplete**<br>(<60%) | Severely inadequate pitch; no clear narrative; fails to address investor concerns; fails to demonstrate features; ineffective live demo; unable to respond to questions; unprofessional presentation style | 0-8 |

**Key Elements to Assess:**
- Clarity and persuasiveness of narrative
- Addressing of investor concerns
- Effective demonstration of key features
- Quality of live demo
- Response to questions
- Professionalism of presentation

## Instructor Notes

### Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Accounting Equation Imbalances**: Students often struggle with maintaining the accounting equation, especially when recording complex transactions. Check that Assets = Liabilities + Equity after each transaction.

2. **Debit/Credit Confusion**: Many students reverse debits and credits, particularly for liability and equity accounts. Verify that students are following the proper rules (debit to increase assets, credit to increase liabilities and equity).

3. **SUMIF Formula Errors**: A common mistake is using incorrect range references in SUMIF formulas. Ensure students are correctly referencing the account column and debit/credit columns.

4. **Conditional Formatting Limitations**: Students may create conditional formatting rules that don't account for all scenarios. Test their red flags with intentional errors to verify functionality.

5. **Pitch Time Management**: Students often try to include too much information in their 4-minute pitch. Encourage them to focus on the most important features and benefits of their ledger.

### Differentiation Strategies

1. **For Struggling Students**: Provide partially completed templates with formula structures already in place. Focus assessment on their understanding of the accounting concepts rather than Excel implementation.

2. **For Advanced Students**: Expect additional features beyond the basic requirements, such as dynamic dropdowns, data validation, or automated financial statements. These students should demonstrate exceptional Excel skills.

### Team Assessment Considerations

If students worked in teams, consider the following:

1. **Individual Contributions**: Use peer evaluations to assess individual contributions to the team project.

2. **Role Fulfillment**: Evaluate how well each student fulfilled their assigned role (Financial modeler, UX/documentation lead, data auditor).

3. **Collaborative Skills**: Assess students' ability to work together, resolve conflicts, and integrate their work into a cohesive final product.
