Check that the code is current with remote branch. Review GitHub issue #104 (Epic: Expand scenario registry across Units 01-08). Work 
issue-by-issue in Sprint 11: select the next unchecked task from the epic checklist, read that issueâ€™s body, confirm acceptance 
criteria, and follow our guardrails (clean `main`, branch `<type>/<issue>-<slug>`, TDD with `npm run lint` + Chrome MCP checks). 
Treat each slice as isolated -- re-derive context from the scenario module and adapters every time. After finishing an issue, update 
docs/sprint/S11.md, bus-math-nextjs/TODO.md, and the epic checklist. Look at the issues and PRs referrred to in the Epic Tracker 
before beginning any work so that you understand what is expected for this issue.
