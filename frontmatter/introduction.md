# Introduction

Welcome to **Business Math & Finance: Applied Accounting with Excel**. This textbook is designed to provide high school students with a comprehensive, project-based approach to learning business mathematics and finance, with a focus on practical applications using Microsoft Excel.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is structured around real-world business scenarios and challenges. Each unit presents a driving question that frames the content and guides your learning. The content is designed to be engaging, relevant, and challenging, with a focus on developing skills that will be valuable in college and career settings.

The textbook is divided into two semesters:

1. **Semester 1: Mini-Projects** - Eight project-based units that introduce key concepts in accounting, finance, and Excel
2. **Semester 2: Capstone Project** - A 13-week comprehensive project where you'll develop a complete business plan and financial model

Each unit includes clear learning objectives, key concepts, examples, exercises, and Excel templates. The content is designed to build progressively, with each unit building on the skills and knowledge developed in previous units.

## Project-Based Learning Approach

This textbook follows the PBLWorks (BIE) Gold Standard Project-Based Learning model, emphasizing:

- **Sustained inquiry** through milestone-based progress
- **Student voice and choice** in all stages of the learning process
- **Peer critique, structured revision, and reflection** to improve work
- **Public-facing deliverables** for real audiences

Each unit is structured around a driving question that frames the learning experience. For example, in Unit 1, you'll explore: "How can we design a self-auditing ledger that would convince a potential angel investor we keep 'clean books' from day 1?"
