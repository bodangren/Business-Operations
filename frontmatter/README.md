# Preface

This textbook is designed to provide high school students with a comprehensive, project-based approach to business mathematics and finance. The content is structured around real-world business scenarios and challenges, with a focus on developing practical skills in Excel and financial modeling.

The textbook is divided into two semesters:

1. **Semester 1**: Eight mini-projects that introduce key concepts in accounting, finance, and Excel
2. **Semester 2**: A 13-week capstone project where students develop a complete business plan and financial model

Each unit includes clear learning objectives, key concepts, examples, exercises, and Excel templates. The content is designed to be engaging, relevant, and challenging, with a focus on developing skills that will be valuable in college and career settings.

I hope this textbook will inspire students to explore the fascinating world of business mathematics and finance, and to develop the skills they need to succeed in their future endeavors.
