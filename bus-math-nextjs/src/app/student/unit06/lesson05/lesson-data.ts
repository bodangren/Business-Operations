  ],
  durationEstimateMinutes: 55,
  pedagogicalApproach: [
    "Direct instruction on advanced Excel automation",
    "Guided build with validation rules and error handling",
    "Independent mastery challenges with edge-case data"
  ],
  rationale: "Students deepen CVP automation by building a scenario runner with Data Tables and strong validation to produce investor-ready insights.",
