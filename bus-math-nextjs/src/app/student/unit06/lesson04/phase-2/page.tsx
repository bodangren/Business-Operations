                      Sarah not only needed to know her break-even point; she also needed to know how to reach her 
                      <em>profit goals</em>. If she wanted to make a certain amount of money, what price should she charge? 
                      Or how many new clients would she need? Trying to guess these numbers by changing values in a 
                      spreadsheet over and over again can be really slow and frustrating. This is where a powerful 
                      Excel tool called <strong>Goal Seek</strong> comes in.

                      </h3>
                      <p className="text-blue-800 mb-4">
                        Think of Goal Seek as a magic button that helps you work backward. Instead of saying, "If I sell 
                        100 items at $20, what's my profit?", Goal Seek lets you say, "I want my profit to be $50,000â€”what 
                        price do I need to charge to make that happen?"
                      </p>
