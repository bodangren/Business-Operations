Welcome to Unit 6: The PriceLab Challenge!

Imagine you're Sarah, the founder of TechStart Solutions. Her business is growing fast, landing bigger projects and even hiring her first employee, Alex. This is exciting, but it also means more expenses. Sarah realized something scary: even with more money coming in, her *profit* was actually going *down*. She was working harder for less profit, which is a big problem for any business trying to grow.

This is a common puzzle for many business owners. They think if they just sell more, they'll make more money. But it's not always true! Sarah had to figure out why her profit margins were shrinking and, more importantly, what she could do about it. She discovered her entire **pricing strategy** was wrong. She was setting prices just to cover her costs, not to reflect the real value her company provided. This unit is all about learning how to avoid Sarah's mistake and how to set prices smartly.

Our big question for this unit is: **What pricing strategy hits our profit target while staying competitive in the local market?**

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:
* Understand the difference between **markup** and **margin** calculations.
* Figure out your **break-even point**—the point where your business isn't losing money or making money.
* Build powerful models in Excel to see how changes in price, costs, or sales volume affect your profit.
* Use these models to make smart pricing decisions that help your business grow and stay strong.

Just like Sarah had to learn how to price her services based on their true worth, you'll learn how to make sure your business ventures are not just busy, but truly profitable. Let's dive in!

### Day 1: Launch & Competitor Data Import – Becoming a Price Detective

Have you ever wondered how a store decides how much to charge for a new video game or a popular snack? Or how a consultant like Sarah decides what to charge for a new website? It's not just a random guess! Businesses constantly look at what their rivals are charging. This is called **competitive intelligence**, and it's super important for setting smart prices.

Today, you're going to become a "price detective." We'll start by seeing how businesses gather this important information.

**The Live Price Scrape Challenge**
Imagine you need to know what your competitors are charging right now. How would you do it without visiting every store or website by hand? Your instructor will show you a cool Excel tool called **Power Query**. Power Query can automatically grab information from websites and turn it into neat, organized data that you can use.

You'll watch as Power Query pulls in live prices from other businesses. You'll see how messy web data gets cleaned up and put into a table in Excel. This shows you how real businesses get fresh, up-to-date information to help them make fast pricing decisions.

After the demonstration, you'll get a chance to use Power Query yourself with some provided competitor pricing data. You'll practice connecting to outside information, cleaning it up, and getting it ready for analysis. Think about it: if you can do this, you can always know what your rivals are up to!

As you look at the data, try to spot any patterns. Are some competitors always cheaper? Do others charge a lot more? Why might that be? These observations are the first clues in becoming a pricing expert.

Finally, we'll set up our "PriceLab" teams. You'll work together, and each team will pick a focus: are you going to aim for the budget market, the middle market, or be a premium (high-priced) business? This choice will guide your pricing strategy throughout the unit.

### Day 2: Markup vs. Margin Concepts – Understanding Profit Percentages

Sarah's big "aha!" moment was realizing she was pricing to cover costs, not for *value*. Part of that problem often comes from confusing two very important business words: **markup** and **margin**. They both sound like they're about profit, but they measure it in different ways, and mixing them up can cost a business a lot of money.

Let's clear up this common confusion. Imagine you buy a t-shirt for $\$10$ and sell it for $\$20$.
* **Markup** looks at the profit as a percentage of your **cost**.
    In our example, your profit is $\$10$. Your cost was $\$10$. So, the markup is $(\$20 - \$10) / \$10 = \$10 / \$10 = 1$, or $100\%$.
    The formula for markup is:
    $$\text{Markup} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%$$

* **Margin** (often called **gross profit margin**) looks at the profit as a percentage of your **selling price**.
    In the same example, your profit is $\$10$. Your selling price was $\$20$. So, the margin is $(\$20 - \$10) / \$20 = \$10 / \$20 = 0.5$, or $50\%$.
    The formula for margin is:
    $$\text{Margin} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Selling Price}} \times 100\%$$

See the difference? Same $\$10$ profit, but $100\%$ markup is very different from $50\%$ margin! Businesses usually care more about *margin* because it tells them how much of each sales dollar they get to keep as profit before other expenses. Financial reports almost always use margin.

We'll practice calculating both markup and margin using the competitor data you imported yesterday. You'll see how knowing both helps you understand how different businesses approach their pricing. By the end of today, you'll be able to quickly tell the difference and explain why it matters to a business owner.

### Day 3: CVP Model Construction – Building Your Profit Roadmap

Sarah's problem wasn't just about understanding markup and margin; it was about knowing if her prices would actually lead to *profit* after paying all her business bills. This is where the **Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Model** comes in. Think of it as a roadmap that shows you how many sales you need to make to cover your costs and, eventually, make a profit.

Every business has two main types of costs:
* **Fixed Costs:** These are expenses that stay the same no matter how much you sell, like rent for an office, salaries for permanent staff, or insurance. Sarah's office rent or Alex's salary are examples of her fixed costs.
* **Variable Costs:** These expenses change based on how much you sell or produce. If you sell more t-shirts, you buy more t-shirts, so the cost of each shirt is a variable cost. For Sarah, this might be the cost of a special software license she needs for *each* client project she takes on.

The CVP formula helps us see the big picture:
$$\text{Profit} = (\text{Price per Unit} \times \text{Number of Units Sold}) - (\text{Variable Cost per Unit} \times \text{Number of Units Sold}) - \text{Total Fixed Costs}$$

Today, you'll build your own CVP model in Excel. You'll create sections for your inputs (like prices, costs, and sales volume guesses), calculations (using the CVP formula), and outputs (showing your projected profit).

A super important part of the CVP model is finding your **break-even point**. This is the number of sales you need to make just to cover all your costs – where your profit is exactly $\$0$. It's a critical number for any business owner to know!
$$\text{Break-Even Point (in Units)} = \frac{\text{Total Fixed Costs}}{\text{Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}$$

You'll also create a visual chart, often called a CVP chart, that shows your costs and revenue lines. Where these lines cross, that's your break-even point! This chart makes it super easy to see how much risk you have and how much you need to sell to be safe. By the end of today, you'll have a working CVP model that helps you predict profit for your chosen business venture.

### Day 4: Peer Critique & Model Refinement – Getting Your Model Investor-Ready

You've done a great job building your first CVP model! But just like Sarah needed her CPA, Jennifer Kim, to guide her in creating professional financial statements, your models also need a "second set of eyes" to make sure they're clear, accurate, and ready to impress. Today is all about getting constructive feedback from your classmates and making your model even better.

We'll set up a "Gallery Walk" in the classroom. This means each team will display their CVP model and chart. You'll then rotate around the room, looking at other teams' work. Your job is to be a helpful business advisor. You'll use a special form to give specific feedback on things like:
* **Mathematical Accuracy:** Are the formulas correct? Does the break-even point look right?
* **Professional Presentation:** Is the Excel model easy to read? Is the chart clear with good labels?
* **Business Logic:** Do the fixed and variable costs make sense for the type of business?
* **Visual Effectiveness:** Does the CVP chart clearly show the break-even point and potential profit?

Remember to focus on being specific and helpful. Instead of saying "Your chart is bad," try "The title on your chart could be clearer if you added the company name" or "I noticed a small error in your variable cost calculation in cell B12". This kind of feedback is super valuable in the real business world.

After the gallery walk, your team will review all the feedback you received. You'll decide which suggestions are most important to fix and make a plan for how to improve your CVP model. This process of getting feedback, thinking about it, and making changes is called **iteration**, and it's how professionals improve their work. By the end of today, you'll have a stronger CVP model and a clear plan to make it even more robust.

### Day 5: Sprint Retrospective & Milestone Assessment – Reflecting on Your Progress

You've almost finished the first half of our PriceLab Challenge! Today is about looking back at everything you've learned and built so far. It's like a mid-season check-in to make sure everyone is on track.

First, your team will do a **Sprint Retrospective**. This is a special kind of meeting where you talk about:
* **What Worked Well:** What techniques or teamwork strategies helped your team succeed this week? Maybe you found a great way to classify costs, or your team collaborated really well.
* **What Was Challenging:** What problems did you run into? Were the formulas tricky? Was it hard to identify fixed vs. variable costs? How did you try to solve those problems?
* **What We Learned:** What are the most important new things you've learned about pricing, costs, and CVP models?
* **Next Steps:** How will you use these lessons to improve your work next week, especially as we move into more advanced analysis?

This reflection helps you understand your own learning journey and how to work better as a team. It's a common practice in fast-paced business environments to constantly learn and adapt.

Next, it's time for our **Milestone 1 Assessment: Competitor Benchmark Analysis & Margin Calculation**. Your team will present your work from Days 1-3 to your instructor. This isn't just about showing your work; it's about explaining your choices. You'll demonstrate:
* How you used **Power Query** to import and clean your competitor data.
* Your accurate calculations of **markup** and **margin** for different products.
* Your initial **CVP model**, showing how you classified costs and calculated the break-even point.
* Any interesting insights you found about your chosen market segment (budget, mid-market, or premium).

The instructor will give you feedback on your technical accuracy and how well your analysis leads to business insights. This feedback is crucial for perfecting your model and preparing for the final presentation. By the end of today, you'll have a clear picture of your progress and what to focus on for the exciting challenges of Week 2!

### Day 6: Goal Seek for Target Profit Scenarios – Asking "What If?"

Sarah not only needed to know her break-even point; she also needed to know how to reach her *profit goals*. If she wanted to make a certain amount of money, what price should she charge? Or how many new clients would she need? Trying to guess these numbers by changing values in a spreadsheet over and over again can be really slow and frustrating. This is where a powerful Excel tool called **Goal Seek** comes in.

Think of Goal Seek as a magic button that helps you work backward. Instead of saying, "If I sell 100 items at $\$20$, what's my profit?", Goal Seek lets you say, "I want my profit to be $\$50,000$—what price do I need to charge to make that happen?"

Goal Seek has three main parts:
1.  **Set Cell:** This is the cell in your spreadsheet that contains the formula you want to change, like your "Total Profit" cell.
2.  **To Value:** This is the specific number you want your "Set Cell" to reach, like $\$50,000$.
3.  **By Changing Cell:** This is the one input cell that Excel will change to reach your target, like your "Price per Unit" cell.

Today, you'll get hands-on with Goal Seek. You'll practice using it to answer important "what if" questions for your CVP model, such as:
* What price do we need to charge to reach a profit target of $\$X$?
* How many units do we need to sell to break even if our costs suddenly go up?
* What's the maximum variable cost we can have and still be profitable at a certain price?

By using Goal Seek, you can quickly explore different scenarios and find the exact numbers you need to hit your business targets. This makes your financial planning much faster and more accurate!

### Day 7: Data Tables for Sensitivity Analysis – Seeing the Big Picture of Risk

While Goal Seek is great for one "what if" question, businesses often need to see how their profit changes across a whole range of possibilities. What if prices change *and* sales volume changes at the same time? What if your costs go up *and* your price goes down? This is where **Data Tables** become your best friend.

Data Tables let you see how a single formula result (like your profit) changes when you vary one or two input variables (like price and sales volume) at the same time. This is called **sensitivity analysis**. It helps you understand how sensitive your profit is to different changes in your business.

You'll learn about two types of Data Tables:
* **One-Variable Data Table:** This shows how your profit changes when only *one* thing varies, like your selling price. You can see how much profit you'd make at $\$18$, $\$19$, $\$20$, and so on.
* **Two-Variable Data Table:** This is even more powerful! It lets you see how your profit changes when *two* things vary at the same time. Imagine seeing a table that shows your profit for different prices *and* different sales volumes all at once.

You'll create these Data Tables in your Excel CVP model. You'll put different prices along one side of the table and different sales volumes along the top. Then, with a special Excel command, you'll magically fill in the profit for every single combination! You can even add **conditional formatting** to color-code the table, showing red for losses, yellow for small profits, and green for big profits. This makes it super easy to spot your "sweet spots" and danger zones.

By the end of today, you'll have a powerful set of tables that reveal the full picture of your business's risks and opportunities. This helps you make more confident pricing decisions because you'll know what to expect even if things don't go exactly as planned.

### Day 8: Pricing Recommendation Development – Crafting Your Business Strategy

You've done a lot of detective work and built some amazing tools! You've analyzed competitor pricing, created a CVP model, used Goal Seek to hit targets, and explored different scenarios with Data Tables. Now, it's time to pull all those insights together and create a clear, compelling **pricing recommendation** for your business.

Think of yourself as a business consultant advising Sarah. She needs a clear plan that answers our essential question: "What pricing strategy hits our profit target while staying competitive in the local market?"

Your recommendation needs to be professional and convincing. It should include:
* **Executive Summary:** A short, powerful summary of your main recommendation and why it's the best choice.
* **Analysis Summary:** This is where you show off your work! Briefly explain how your competitor analysis, CVP model, and sensitivity analysis led you to your recommendation. Include your charts and data tables here.
* **Implementation Details:** What specific prices should your business charge? Are there different prices for different products or services?
* **Risk Mitigation:** What are the potential challenges, and how can your business deal with them? For example, if a competitor suddenly drops their prices, what's your backup plan?

You'll decide whether to create a formal **memo** (a written report) or a **slide deck** (like a PowerPoint presentation). Both formats are used in the business world, and you'll choose the one that best showcases your analysis and makes your case. Remember, your goal is to be persuasive and professional.

Today is a big day for putting all the pieces together. By the end of this session, you'll have a strong draft of your pricing recommendation, ready for the next step: defending it!

### Day 9: Town Hall Debate Preparation – Getting Ready to Persuade

Imagine Sarah has decided to propose a new pricing strategy to her team and maybe even some early investors. Not everyone might agree right away! There could be concerns about losing customers, or whether the numbers are truly realistic. This is why you need to be ready to **defend your recommendation**.

Today, we're going to prepare for a "Town Hall Debate." This isn't about being aggressive, but about being able to confidently explain your analysis and answer tough questions. Your audience will be like different people Sarah might encounter: an economics teacher (who cares about the math!), PTA representatives (who might care about affordability for students), and local entrepreneurs (who care about profit and staying competitive).

You'll work with your team to develop strong arguments for your chosen pricing strategy. Think about:
* What are the absolute strongest points in your analysis? Focus on the data that most clearly supports your recommendation.
* What questions or concerns might the "panel" have? For example, if you recommend higher prices, they might ask, "Won't we lose customers?" How will you use your data to answer that? You might show your sensitivity analysis indicating that even with a small drop in volume, you'd still be more profitable.
* How can you use your CVP model and data tables during your presentation to quickly show how different scenarios play out?

You'll also **rehearse** your initial presentation and practice answering tough questions. It's okay to practice! Even the most confident business leaders rehearse important presentations. You'll assign roles within your team: who will be the main presenter, who is the "technical expert" ready to dive into the Excel model, and who will handle the rebuttals (answers to challenges)?

By the end of today, you'll feel much more confident and prepared to present and defend your data-driven pricing strategy. You'll be ready to show that your recommendations aren't just guesses, but are backed by solid math and smart business thinking.

### Day 10: Town Hall Pricing Debate & Reflection – The Final Pitch

This is it! The culmination of all your hard work in the PriceLab Challenge. Today, you'll step into the role of a business leader and present your data-driven pricing strategy to a "Town Hall" panel.

Each team will deliver a 4-minute presentation, explaining your pricing recommendation and showing off your CVP model and sensitivity analysis in Excel. This is your chance to shine and convince the panel that your strategy is the best path forward for your business venture.

The panel members will act as different stakeholders with various concerns. They will ask questions, challenge your assumptions, and even present opposing viewpoints. Your job is to:
* **Clearly explain your recommendation:** Make it easy to understand, even for people who aren't experts in Excel.
* **Back up your claims with data:** Use your CVP model, charts, and data tables to show why your numbers make sense.
* **Respond professionally to questions:** Even if a question is tough, stay calm and use your analysis to provide clear, evidence-based answers.
* **Demonstrate your expertise:** Show that you truly understand the relationship between costs, volume, and profit.

After the presentations, we'll take time for a **reflection**. This is a chance for you to think about:
* How did building the CVP models and doing the analysis change your understanding of how businesses set prices?
* What was the most valuable part of learning about sensitivity analysis?
* What surprised you about competitive pricing or the debate process?
* How can you use these powerful analytical skills in other areas of business, or even in your own life?

Finally, you'll add your completed pricing recommendation and CVP model to your digital portfolio. This is a great way to showcase the incredible skills you've developed. You've learned how to turn complex financial data into a clear, persuasive business strategy, just like Sarah did to make TechStart Solutions truly profitable and sustainable!
