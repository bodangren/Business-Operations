                  Welcome to the world of business operations! It's a place where a great idea needs a great plan to succeed. 
                  This unit is all about building one of the most important parts of that plan: a trustworthy system for managing money. 
                  To guide us, we'll follow the story of a new entrepreneur named Sarah Chen, the founder of a digital marketing startup called TechStart Solutions.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-8">Sarah's Initial Success</h3>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  When Sarah first launched her company, the feeling was incredible. She was passionate and talented, and clients noticed. 
                  She landed three projects back-to-back: a new website for a local bakery worth $2,200, a social media setup for a pet grooming service for $650, 
                  and search engine optimization (SEO) work for a dental office for $1,100. The money was coming in, and it felt like her dream was becoming a reality.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-8">The Hidden Crisis</h3>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  But as Sarah herself admits, there was chaos behind the curtain. While she was focused on delivering great work for her clients, 
                  her own business records were a disaster. She was tracking every payment, every invoice, and every small software subscription by 
                  scribbling it down in a notebook. She thought she could keep it all straight in her head, but she quickly felt overwhelmed.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The real wake-up call came when she started thinking about taxes. Looking at her stack of notebooks, a wave of panic hit her. 
                  How could she possibly pull accurate numbers from that mess? If an accountant asked for a specific receipt, would it take her a week to find it? 
                  She realized her system wasn't just messy; it was a huge risk to her business.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-8">Our Challenge</h3>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  This is the exact challenge we are taking on. Our driving question for this entire unit is this: 
                  <strong>"How can we design a self-auditing ledger that would convince a potential angel investor we keep 'clean books' from day 1?"</strong> 
                  Sarah's story is our case study. We are going to step in and help her build the system she needs.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Before you can build, however, you must understand the fundamental language of business. The disconnect between Sarah's operational success 
                  and her financial chaos illustrates a critical truth: even the most talented entrepreneurs can face serious business risks without proper 
                  financial systems. This is why investors, lenders, and business partners all look for evidence of "clean books" before they're willing 
                  to trust their money with a business.
