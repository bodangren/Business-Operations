              Imagine Sarah looking at her three successful projects: $2,200 from the bakery, 
              $650 from the pet grooming service, and $1,100 from the dental office. That's 
              $3,950 in total! But she also has $500 in monthly software subscriptions, 
              a $1,200 computer, and she owes $300 on a printer she bought last month.
