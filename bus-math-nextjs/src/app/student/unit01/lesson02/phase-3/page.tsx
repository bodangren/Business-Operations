        "One asset (cash) decreases by $1,200, another asset (computer) increases by $1,200",

        "Liabilities increase by $1,200",

      ],
      explanation: "This is an asset-to-asset transaction. Cash (asset) decreases by $1,200 while Computer Equipment (asset) increases by $1,200. Total assets remain the same, so the equation stays balanced."

        "The equation becomes unbalanced"

      explanation: "Cash (assets) increases by $5,000 because money entered the business account. Bank Loan Payable (liabilities) also increases by $5,000 because the business now owes this money. Both sides of the equation increase equally."

              Every transaction affects <strong>at least two</strong> components of the equation, 
              but the equation <strong>always stays balanced</strong>. This is why it's called 
              "double-entry" bookkeeping - there are always two sides to every financial story.
