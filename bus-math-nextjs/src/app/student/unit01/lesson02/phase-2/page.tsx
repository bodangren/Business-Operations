              All business, from the smallest startup to the largest corporation, operates under one 
              unbreakable rule. It's a rule of perfect balance, and it's the foundation of all 
              financial tracking. This is the <strong>Accounting Equation</strong>:

              Think of this equation as a scale that must always, without exception, be balanced. 
              Every single financial event in a business, called a transaction, will affect at 
              least two parts of this scale, but it will never go out of balance.
