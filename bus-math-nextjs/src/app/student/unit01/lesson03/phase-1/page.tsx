      "Debit and Credit",
      "Doctor and Creditor", 
      "Drive and Create",
      "Decrease and Reduce"

    id: "tAccount-shape",
    question: "Why do accountants use a 'T-Account' to visualize transactions?",
    answers: [
      "The T-shape clearly separates debits (left side) from credits (right side)",
      "It looks like a table for organizing data",
      "The T stands for 'Transaction'", 
      "It's the most colorful way to show numbers"

    question: "In Sarah's accounting system, what must ALWAYS be true for every transaction she records?",
    answers: [
      "Total debits must equal total credits",
      "She must have more assets than liabilities",
      "Every entry needs at least 5 accounts",
      "All amounts must be positive numbers"
    ],
    explanation: "The fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping is that for every transaction, total debits must equal total credits. This ensures the accounting equation stays in balance."

              Sarah's been learning about the accounting equation, but now she's confused by all the 
              "Dr." and "Cr." markings in her accounting examples. Let's discover the elegant system

                  Sarah sits at her desk, staring at her accounting textbook with a puzzled expression. 
                  She understands that <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong>, but now every 
                  example shows these strange T-shaped diagrams with "Dr." and "Cr." written everywhere.

                <p>
                  "What do these abbreviations even mean?" she wonders. "And why does everything have 
                  to be split into left and right sides? There must be some logic to this system that 
                  makes it so universally used by accountants."

                  Little does Sarah know, she's about to discover one of the most elegant organizational 
                  systems ever created for businessâ€”one that will transform her messy notebook tracking 
                  into a professional, self-auditing ledger system.

                Understanding debits and credits isn't just about following accounting rulesâ€”it's about 
                building the systematic thinking that investors and lenders look for in entrepreneurs. 
                When Sarah can explain why every transaction has two sides and demonstrate this with 
                T-accounts, she shows that she truly understands how money flows through her business. 
                This foundational knowledge will allow her to build Excel models that automatically 
                catch errors and maintain the perfect balance that gives investors confidence.
