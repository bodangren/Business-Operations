              It's 3 PM on a Friday. Sarah just processed payroll for her first employee, Alex. 
              The money left her business account instantly. Over the weekend, her business was busy and made great sales. 
              But when she checks her account Monday morningâ€”disaster strikes.

                Maria's cafÃ© was thriving. Her employees were happy, customers loved her coffee, and business was good. 
                Every Friday, she ran payroll like clockworkâ€”a routine she'd done dozens of times before.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                But this particular Friday was different. After processing payroll, she noticed her account balance was getting low. 
                "No problem," she thought. "We'll have a busy weekend, and I'll deposit the cash sales Monday morning."

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
                Monday morning arrived with a shock: her account was overdrawn. The payroll checks were bouncing.

                  Maria had the moneyâ€”her weekend sales proved that. But she didn't have it when she needed it. 
                  The payroll left her account instantly on Friday, but the weekend cash wouldn't be available until Monday. 
                  Now she faced an impossible choice: let her employees' paychecks bounce and lose their trust, 
                  or take out an expensive emergency loan to cover the gap.

                The solution is clear: hire her first employee, Alex, a talented developer.
