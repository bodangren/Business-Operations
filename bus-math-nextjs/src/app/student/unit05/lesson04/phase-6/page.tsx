                  From Basic Calculator to Bulletproof Business System
                </h2>
                
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Congratulations! You've transformed from someone who builds basic Excel calculators 
                  into someone who designs professional, bulletproof business systems. The data validation 
                  and conditional formatting skills you've mastered represent a fundamental shift in 
                  thinkingâ€”from reactive problem-solving to proactive problem prevention.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Sarah's $3,200 mistake taught you that accuracy alone isn't enough in business. 
                  Professional systems must be reliable, user-friendly, and designed to prevent errors 
                  before they can cause damage. These are the same principles that separate successful 
                  businesses from those that struggle with operational problems.
                </p>

                  The bulletproof validation system you've built is a critical foundation for answering 
                  this question. Before Sarah can predict cash flow timing, she needs to trust that her 
                  payroll calculations are accurate and error-free. The validation features you've mastered 
                  ensure that every paycheck calculation is correct, providing the reliable foundation 
                  needed for cash flow forecasting and business growth.
