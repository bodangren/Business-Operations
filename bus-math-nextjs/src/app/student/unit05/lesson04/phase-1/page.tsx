                  The $3,200 Mistake
                </h2>
                
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Sarah thought her payroll calculator was perfect. She had tested it with Alex's salary, 
                  and the numbers looked right. Gross pay: $2,500 for two weeks. Federal taxes: $312. 
                  State taxes: $125. FICA: $191.25. Net pay: $1,871.75. Everything balanced perfectly.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Then disaster struck. While rushing to process payroll for her second employee, Maria, 
                  Sarah accidentally typed "80" instead of "8" in the overtime hours cell. The calculator 
                  dutifully computed 80 hours of overtime at time-and-a-half, generating a paycheck for 
                  $3,200 instead of $320.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Sarah didn't notice the error until Maria called, confused about the massive deposit 
                  in her account. By then, the damage was doneâ€”Sarah had to explain the mistake, ask 
                  for the money back, and deal with the payroll tax complications. Worse, she realized 
                  her "perfect" calculator was actually a disaster waiting to happen.

                  <strong>The Real Cost:</strong> This single typo cost Sarah over $2,800 in overpayment, 
                  plus additional hours fixing tax withholdings, and potential damage to her professional 
                  reputation. A "bulletproof" system with data validation would have prevented this entirely.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  That night, Sarah researched professional payroll systems and discovered they all had 
                  one thing in common: they were designed to prevent mistakes, not just calculate accurately. 
                  They used something called "data validation" to stop impossible entries before they 
                  could cause damage.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Sarah realized her calculator needed to be more than correctâ€”it needed to be 
                  <strong> bulletproof</strong>. It should refuse to accept 80 overtime hours for someone 
                  who only worked 40 regular hours. It should highlight suspicious numbers in red. 
                  It should guide users toward correct entries and away from costly mistakes.

                  Today you'll transform your basic payroll calculator into a professional, bulletproof 
                  system using Excel's Data Validation and Conditional Formatting features. You'll learn 
                  to prevent errors before they happen, create visual alerts for suspicious data, and 
                  build the kind of robust financial tool that actual businesses depend on. This isn't 
                  just about Excel skillsâ€”it's about professional system design and error prevention.
