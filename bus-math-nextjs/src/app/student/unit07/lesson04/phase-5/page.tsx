        "FIFO",
        "Weighted Average",
        "Specific Identification"
      ],
      explanation: "LIFO assigns the most recent (higher) costs to COGS, lowering profit."

      answers: [
        "Excel Tables with structured references",

      answers: [
        "Flag the row as an error until corrected",
        "Ignore the row",
        "Set the cost to zero",
        "Hide the row so it doesnâ€™t print"

      answers: [
        "XLOOKUP",
        "HLOOKUP",
        "OFFSET",

        "$1,200",
        "$1,320",
        "$1,440"

      question: "Which statement aligns with investor expectations?",
      answers: [
        "Models should include clear method labels and validation checks",
        "Pretty colors are enough if totals look right",
        "Hiding inputs makes models â€˜cleanerâ€™",
        "Manual updates are fine if documented"

      question: "What is a safe way to calculate weighted totals by condition?",
      answers: [
        "SUMPRODUCT with logical tests",
        "SUM over visible cells only",
        "Manually multiplying and summing each row",
        "COUNTIF plus SUM"
      ],
      explanation: "SUMPRODUCT can multiply arrays filtered by conditions for weighted sums."

      question: "If prices are falling, which method likely shows higher profit?",
      answers: [
        "FIFO",
        "LIFO",
        "Both are the same",
        "Neither method affects profit"

      id: "a9",
      question: "Which is the best description of a â€˜layerâ€™ in inventory valuation?",
      answers: [
        "A batch of units purchased at the same cost",
        "A formatting style in Excel",
        "A worksheet tab",
        "A pivot table filter"
      ],
      explanation: "Each purchase at a given unit cost forms a cost layer used for allocation."

      id: "a10",
      question: "What should you do after adding two new purchases to test robustness?",
      answers: [
        "Verify COGS and Ending Inventory update without editing formulas",
        "Rebuild all formulas from scratch",
        "Change the sheet protection settings",
        "Screenshot the workbook"
