    question: "When Sarah spent $18,000 on new computers and office furniture for TechStart Solutions, why did her CPA Jennifer tell her to stop recording this as a simple expense?",
    answers: [
      "These items are long-term assets that will help her business for years, not just one month",
      "She doesn't have enough cash to cover the expense right now",
      "The items cost too much money to be considered business expenses", 
      "Jennifer wanted Sarah to return the equipment to save money"
    ],
    explanation: "Jennifer recognized that computers and office furniture are long-term assets that will benefit TechStart Solutions over multiple years, making them candidates for depreciation rather than immediate expensing."
  },
  {
    id: "hook-2", 
    question: "What is the main business concept that Sarah discovered when she realized her new computers would help her business for years?",
    answers: [
      "Depreciation - spreading the cost of long-term assets over their useful life",
      "Appreciation - increasing the value of assets over time",
      "Amortization - paying off loans in equal monthly payments",
      "Capitalization - borrowing money to buy expensive equipment"
    ],
    explanation: "Sarah discovered depreciation, which is the accounting method of spreading the cost of long-term assets over the years they will be used to generate revenue."
  },
  {
    id: "hook-3",
    question: "Why is choosing the right depreciation method important for a business like TechStart Solutions?",
    answers: [
      "It affects cash flow, tax obligations, and the company's official value",
      "It determines how much money Sarah can spend on new equipment",
      "It decides which insurance company she should choose for coverage",
      "It controls how many employees she can hire for the business"
    ],
    explanation: "Depreciation method selection has significant financial implications - it affects taxable income (and thus taxes), cash flow timing, and how assets appear on financial statements that investors review."
  },
  {
    id: "hook-4",
    question: "What triggered Sarah's need to understand asset depreciation beyond just the $18,000 purchase?",
    answers: [
      "Her business insurance policy needed a detailed list of all physical assets",
      "The bank required a list of assets before approving a business loan", 
      "Her customers wanted to see a list of her business equipment",
      "The government required all businesses to file asset depreciation reports"
    ],
    explanation: "Sarah's new business insurance policy needed a detailed asset list, which highlighted the importance of properly tracking and valuing her business assets over time."

              Now, TechStart Solutions has moved into its first real office! This is a huge milestone, a sign that

              <p className="text-green-800">
                Sarah made a significant investment, spending about <strong>$18,000</strong> on brand new computers, 
                software, and office furniture to get everything set up perfectly. Her first thought was simple: 
                just record this $18,000 as a big expense, like buying paper clips or paying the internet bill.

                But her CPA, Jennifer Kim, immediately told her to <strong>stop</strong>. Jennifer explained that 
                these items weren't just simple expenses; they were <em>long-term assets</em>. How Sarah accounted 
                for them would have a big impact on her taxes and the official value of her company.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-green-900">
              This was a big "aha!" moment for Sarah. She realized that these new items, like her powerful new 
              computers, would help her business for years, not just for a single month. This introduced her to 
              a powerful accounting concept: <strong>depreciation</strong>.
