              When Sarah bought $18,000 worth of new equipment for TechStart Solutions, it was a big expense. 
              But Jennifer, her CPA, explained that it's not like buying a coffee. That equipment will last 
              for many years and help TechStart earn money over that time. So, instead of counting the whole 
              $18,000 as an expense in one go, businesses <strong>depreciate</strong> these long-term assets.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-blue-900">
              Depreciation is basically a way of spreading the cost of a long-term asset (like a building, 
              machine, or computer) over the years it will be used. Think of it like a car. You don't pay 
              for the entire car's "usefulness" in the first month. Instead, its value slowly decreases as 
              you use it over several years. Depreciation matches this idea ‚Äì it recognizes that an asset's 
              value is used up over time.

              more depreciation expense in the early years of an asset's life and less in later years. 
              This can be good for taxes because it means higher tax deductions sooner, improving cash flow.
