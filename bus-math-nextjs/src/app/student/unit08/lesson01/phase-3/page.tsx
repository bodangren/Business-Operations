            Now that you understand what venture capitalists look for in financial models and the common red flags that can kill funding, it's time to practice identifying these issues in real startup scenarios. In this guided practice, you'll work with your teacher and classmates to develop the critical eye of a professional investor.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Remember Sarah's challenge: she needs to create a model that avoids red flags while demonstrating the sophistication that comes from three-statement integration. Today, you'll practice the evaluation skills that will help you build that same level of quality in your own models.

            How VCs Evaluate Financial Models

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            When venture capitalists receive a financial model from a startup, they follow a systematic evaluation process. Understanding this process will help you build models that pass their scrutiny:

            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-blue-800">
              <li><strong>Technical Check:</strong> Do the formulas work? Are sheets properly linked? Any circular references?</li>
              <li><strong>Assumption Review:</strong> Are growth rates realistic? Are costs based on research or guesswork?</li>
              <li><strong>Scenario Testing:</strong> Did they consider different outcomes? What happens if sales are 50% lower?</li>
              <li><strong>Presentation Quality:</strong> Is it professional? Easy to navigate? Would I feel confident showing this to my partners?</li>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Each of these areas can make or break an investment decision. A technically perfect model with unrealistic assumptions will get rejected just as quickly as a model with great assumptions but broken formulas.
