    question: "Sarah sets up Scenario Manager with three scenarios for TechStart's financial model. Which Excel feature automatically creates a side-by-side comparison report of all scenarios?",
    answers: [
      "Scenario Summary Report - accessible from the Scenario Manager dialog",
      "PivotTable Summary with scenario data",
      "Chart Wizard with multiple data series",
      "Data Validation with dropdown scenarios"
    ],
    explanation: "The Scenario Summary Report is automatically generated by Excel's Scenario Manager and shows all scenarios, their changing cell values, and result cell outcomes in a professional comparison table."
  },
  {
    id: "assessment-2",
    question: "In Sarah's financial model, she wants the formula =Monthly_Revenue * Growth_Rate to work correctly when Scenario Manager changes the Growth_Rate assumption. How should the Growth_Rate cell be referenced?",
    answers: [
      "=Monthly_Revenue * $B$5 where B5 contains the growth rate with absolute references",
      "=Monthly_Revenue * B5 using relative references that will adjust automatically",
      "=Monthly_Revenue * INDIRECT(\"Growth_Rate\") using an indirect reference",
      "=Monthly_Revenue * 0.20 by hard-coding the growth rate value"
    ],
    explanation: "Absolute references ($B$5) ensure that when Scenario Manager switches between scenarios, the formula always points to the correct assumption cell without breaking."
  },
  {
    id: "assessment-3",
    question: "Sarah's VC asks: 'What's your monthly recurring revenue in Month 12 under the pessimistic scenario?' Sarah uses Scenario Manager to instantly switch and shows $847,000. What does this demonstrate?",
    answers: [
      "Dynamic modeling capability that builds investor confidence in the analysis",
      "That Sarah memorized all her numbers perfectly for the presentation",
      "That pessimistic scenarios always show lower revenue than realistic ones",
      "That Excel can calculate compound growth automatically"
    ],
    explanation: "The ability to instantly answer 'what if' questions by switching scenarios demonstrates sophisticated financial modeling that professional investors expect from fundable startups."
  },

    id: "assessment-4",
    question: "Sarah creates a Data Table to show how her startup's Net Present Value (NPV) changes when Customer Acquisition Cost varies from $200-$400. This is an example of:",
    answers: [
      "Sensitivity Analysis - showing how key outputs respond to changes in critical input variables",
      "Scenario Analysis - comparing optimistic vs pessimistic business conditions",
      "Financial Forecasting - predicting future business performance",
      "Budget Analysis - tracking actual vs planned expenses"
    ],
    explanation: "Sensitivity Analysis uses Data Tables to systematically vary one or two input variables and observe their impact on key outputs, helping identify which variables matter most to business success."

    id: "assessment-5",
    question: "A venture capitalist tells Sarah: 'Your base case looks good, but what if there's a recession and your churn rate doubles from 5% to 10%?' What advanced Excel technique should Sarah have prepared to answer this instantly?",
    answers: [
      "A specific 'Economic Downturn' scenario in Scenario Manager with higher churn assumptions",
      "A separate Excel file with recession-specific calculations",
      "A calculator to manually recompute all the numbers during the meeting",
      "A PowerPoint slide showing general recession impact on similar businesses"
    ],
    explanation: "Professional financial models include specific business scenario testing (like economic downturns) beyond just optimistic/realistic/pessimistic cases, allowing instant responses to investor concerns."
