    question: "What must the top-left cell of a two-variable Data Table contain?",
    answers: [
      "A reference to the output cell",
      "The row input value",
      "The column input value",
      "Any number (itâ€™s ignored)"
    ],
    explanation: "The corner cell references the single result you want the table to fill for each input pair."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-2",
    question: "Which formula best switches scenarios by name and prevents #N/A errors?",
    answers: [
      "IFNA(XLOOKUP(Scenario, DriversTbl[Scenario], DriversTbl[@Growth_Rate], 0), 0)",
      "VLOOKUP(Scenario, DriversTbl, 2)",
      "INDEX(DriversTbl[Growth_Rate], 2)",
      "MATCH(Scenario, DriversTbl[Scenario], 1)"
    ],
    explanation: "Use exact match with XLOOKUP and wrap in IFNA (or IFERROR) for resilience."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-3",
    question: "Why use structured references (Table[Column]) in a three-statement model?",
    answers: [
      "They expand automatically and reduce broken ranges",
      "They calculate faster than normal ranges",
      "They format numbers automatically",
      "They hide sheets from viewers"
    ],
    explanation: "Structured refs keep formulas stable when rows are added or data grows."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-4",
    question: "Your sensitivity grid shows Net Income rising while Cash falls. Whatâ€™s a likely reason?",
    answers: [
      "Timing differences like receivables or inventory",
      "A Data Table bug always reverses signs",
      "The profit formula is wrong by definition",
      "Cash and profit are always identical"
    ],
    explanation: "Profit and cash differ due to working capital and non-cash items."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-5",
    question: "Which validation is most critical before an investor demo?",
    answers: [
      "Stale AsOfDate older than 90 days",
      "Cell background colors",
      "Merged heading cells",
      "Tab name capitalization"
    ],
    explanation: "Stale dates and out-of-range inputs undermine credibility; flag them clearly."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-6",
    question: "For a Data Table, where do you link the row and column input cells?",
    answers: [
      "In the Whatâ€‘If Analysis dialog for the table range",
      "In the Name Manager",
      "Inside the output formula",
      "Anywhere on the sheet, it doesnâ€™t matter"
    ],
    explanation: "Use the Whatâ€‘If Analysis &gt; Data Table dialog to set Row input cell and Column input cell."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-7",
    question: "Which change most improves auditability?",
    answers: [
      "Add named ranges for key drivers and label units",
      "Hide all helper columns",
      "Color cells randomly",
      "Replace formulas with values"
    ],
    explanation: "Named ranges and labels help reviewers follow logic without digging through coordinates."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-8",
    question: "A new driver row is added to DriversTbl. Your model breaks. What likely caused it?",
    answers: [
      "Hardâ€‘coded ranges instead of table references",
      "Too many named ranges",
      "Using IFNA",
      "Using EXACT() in a formula"
    ],
    explanation: "Avoid fixed ranges; table references expand with new rows and keep links stable."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-9",
    question: "What should an executive summary include?",
    answers: [
      "Key sensitivity drivers, thresholds, and recommended actions",
      "All raw formulas for each sheet",
      "Full monthly ledger details",
      "A list of keyboard shortcuts"
    ],
    explanation: "Investors want the story: where risk concentrates and what decisions follow."
  },
  {
    id: "u08l05-assess-10",
    question: "Which approach reduces fragile links most?",
    answers: [
      "Group inputs on an Inputs sheet and reference them consistently",
      "Scatter inputs across many sheets for convenience",
      "Use hidden constants",
      "Replace XLOOKUP with manual edits"
