              The Weekend Nightmare
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Sarah thought she had solved her bookkeeping problems with her "Smart Ledger" from Unit 1. 
              Her business was growing, she landed her first monthly retainer client, and life was good. 
              But then came her first real month-end closing...

              <p className="text-red-700">
                Sarah spent her entire weekend hunched over her laptop, cross-referencing every transaction. 
                She found dozens of tiny errorsâ€”typos, missed subscription fees, small mistakes that threw 
                off her totals. Each error sent her on long, frustrating hunts for the source of the problem.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Her "smart" ledger was still completely manual, eating up her most valuable resource: time. 
              She had solved one problem only to create another.

              on administrative work. Marcus was direct and transformative in his response.

              have serious consequences down the road.
