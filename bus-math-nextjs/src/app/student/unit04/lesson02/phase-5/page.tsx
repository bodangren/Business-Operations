      question: "A cafÃ© manager discovers that their POS system exports data with product names like ' Latte', 'Latte ', and 'LATTE' all appearing as separate items. What Excel function should they use FIRST to fix this problem?",
      answers: [
        "TRIM to remove extra spaces, then standardize capitalization",
        "Remove Duplicates to eliminate identical entries",
        "Text-to-Columns to separate the data",
        "VLOOKUP to find correct product names"
      ],
      explanation: "The TRIM function removes leading and trailing spaces, which is the first step before standardizing capitalization. This ensures 'Latte', ' Latte', and 'Latte ' all become 'Latte' before addressing case differences."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-2",
      question: "Sarah's client gives her a dataset where timestamps appear as '2023-10-15T14:30:22'. She needs separate Date and Time columns for her analysis. Which Excel tool would be most efficient?",
      answers: [
        "Text-to-Columns using 'T' as the delimiter",
        "Find and Replace to remove the 'T'",
        "Manual copy and paste for each entry",
        "Delete the entire timestamp column"
      ],
      explanation: "Text-to-Columns can split the timestamp at the 'T' delimiter, automatically creating separate Date and Time columns in one operation. This is much more efficient than manual methods."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-3",
      question: "You're analyzing sales data and find that removing duplicates reduced your dataset from 15,000 to 14,850 transactions. What should your next step be?",
      answers: [
        "Investigate why 150 duplicates existed to prevent future data quality issues",
        "Assume the POS system is working correctly and continue analysis",
        "Add the duplicates back to avoid losing data",
        "Report the issue to IT but continue with current analysis"
      ],
      explanation: "Finding 150 duplicate transactions (1% of data) suggests a systematic problem with the data collection process. A professional analyst investigates root causes to prevent recurring data quality issues."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-4",
      question: "A business analyst notices that their cleaned dataset still shows unusual patterns: 'Coffee' sales spike dramatically at 3 AM on weekends. What's the most likely explanation?",
      answers: [
        "The timestamp cleaning process may have errors that need validation",
        "The cafÃ© is busier at 3 AM than during normal hours",
        "Coffee is more popular on weekends",
        "The cleaning process worked perfectly"
      ],
      explanation: "Unusual patterns like 3 AM sales spikes often indicate data cleaning errors, possibly in timestamp processing or timezone conversions. Always validate cleaned data against logical business patterns."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-5",
      question: "Which of the following scenarios would cause the MOST severe business impact if data cleaning is skipped?",
      answers: [
        "Inventory system ordering double the needed pastries due to duplicate sales entries",
        "Customer names having inconsistent capitalization in the database",
        "Product descriptions having extra spaces that don't affect calculations",
        "Date formats being displayed differently in reports"
      ],
      explanation: "Duplicate sales entries directly impact financial calculations and inventory decisions. Ordering double the pastries leads to waste, spoilage, and direct financial loss, making this the most severe business impact."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-6",
      question: "You're preparing cafÃ© data for statistical analysis and discover entries like 'Iced Coffee', 'IcedCoffee', 'Iced_Coffee', and 'ICED COFFEE'. How should a professional data analyst handle this?",
      answers: [
        "Standardize all variations to one format (e.g., 'Iced Coffee') and document the decision",
        "Keep all variations to preserve original data integrity",
        "Remove all entries that don't match the most common format",
        "Use only the first occurrence and delete the rest"
      ],
      explanation: "Professional data cleaning requires standardization to ensure accurate analysis while documenting decisions for transparency. All variations should be converted to one standard format with clear documentation."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-7",
      question: "TechStart Solutions' client provides transaction data where amounts appear as '$4.50', '4.5', '4.50', and '$04.50'. What's the best approach for analysis?",
      answers: [
        "Convert all to consistent number format (4.50) removing symbols and leading zeros",
        "Leave as text format to preserve original appearance",
        "Use only entries that are already in number format",
        "Replace all with the most common format"
      ],
      explanation: "For numerical analysis, amounts must be converted to a consistent number format. Removing currency symbols and standardizing decimal places ensures calculations work correctly while maintaining data integrity."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-8",
      question: "After cleaning a large dataset, what's the most important validation step before beginning analysis?",
      answers: [
        "Compare key statistics (totals, counts, ranges) between original and cleaned data to ensure integrity",
        "Check that the file size has decreased after cleaning",
        "Verify that all text entries use the same capitalization",
        "Confirm that the number of columns has increased"
      ],
      explanation: "Data integrity validation is crucial. Comparing key statistics ensures the cleaning process didn't introduce errors or accidentally remove legitimate data. This professional practice prevents analysis based on corrupted cleaned data."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-9",
      question: "The cafÃ© manager asks: 'How do I know if my cleaned data is analysis-ready?' What's the best professional response?",
      answers: [
        "Clean data has consistent formats, no duplicates, standardized categories, and passes validation checks against business logic",
        "All text is properly capitalized and there are no spaces",
        "The data looks neat and organized in the spreadsheet",
        "Excel can open the file without error messages"
      ],
      explanation: "Analysis-ready data meets multiple professional standards: consistent formatting, no duplicates, standardized categories, and logical validation. This comprehensive definition ensures reliable analysis results."
    },
    {
      id: "assessment-10",
      question: "Sarah learns that 60-80% of data analysts' time is spent on cleaning data. Why is this such a critical skill in modern business?",
      answers: [
        "Real-world data is inherently messy, and business decisions require reliable, clean data for accuracy",
        "Data cleaning is the most difficult part of analysis work",
        "Cleaning data impresses clients more than analysis results",
        "It's a requirement for all data analyst certifications"
      ],
      explanation: "Data cleaning is critical because real-world data from various sources (POS systems, sensors, forms) is inherently messy. Business decisions based on dirty data can be catastrophically wrong, making cleaning a crucial professional skill."
