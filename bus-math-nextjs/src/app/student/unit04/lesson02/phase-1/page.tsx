      answers: [
        "Information would be inconsistent and hard to search through",
        "Notebooks are more expensive than digital systems",
        "Clients prefer digital payment tracking",
        "Notebooks take up too much office space"
      ],
      explanation: "Handwritten data is often inconsistent, has typos, and can't be easily searched or analyzed. This makes it nearly impossible to spot patterns or make data-driven decisions."

      question: "The cafÃ© manager gives you 15,000 transactions from their POS system. What would be the FIRST step before trying to find business insights?",
      answers: [
        "Clean and organize the data to make it reliable",
        "Create charts and graphs immediately",
        "Calculate the average transaction amount",
        "Look for the highest-selling items"
      ],
      explanation: "Real-world data is always messy. Before any analysis can be trusted, the data must be cleaned to remove errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies."

      id: "messy-data-3",
      question: "What would happen if you tried to analyze data that had extra spaces around product names (like 'Coffee ' vs 'Coffee')?",
      answers: [
        "Excel would treat them as different products, giving wrong totals",
        "The analysis would automatically fix the spacing",
        "Only the first version would be counted",
        "The spaces wouldn't affect the analysis"
      ],
      explanation: "Excel sees 'Coffee ' and 'Coffee' as completely different items. This would split your coffee sales between two categories, making your analysis incorrect."

                I need to know why we're throwing away so much food, but every time I try to look at this data,

                Some transactions appear twice because a cashier accidentally double-clicked. There are even entries 
                for "-$2.50" where someone had to process a refund.

                  Just like Sarah learned to build systems that could handle real business complexity, you need to 
                  master the art of <strong>data cleaning</strong>â€”transforming messy, real-world data into something 
                  you can actually analyze and trust.

                Data cleaning isn't just a boring technical skillâ€”it's the foundation that separates successful 
                data analysts from those who make costly mistakes. When Sarah started making data-driven decisions 
                for TechStart Solutions, the first thing she learned was that <strong>garbage data in equals 
                garbage decisions out</strong>.

                spends 60-80% of their time cleaning data. Master this skill, and you'll have the foundation to 
                make decisions that can save businesses thousands of dollars and help them serve customers better.
