                Before you can find any brilliant insights, you have to face a universal truth of data analysis: 
                <strong>real-world data is always messy</strong>. Think back to Sarah's early days with her notebooks‚Äîthat 
                was a messy system. Digital data can be just as chaotic.

                The raw data from the caf√©'s POS system might have extra spaces, inconsistent names for menu items, 
                or even accidental duplicate entries from a cashier hitting a button twice. If you try to analyze 
                messy data, you'll get messy results. It's like trying to build a house on a crooked foundation.

                  Data cleaning is the essential first step of every professional analysis project. It's the process 
                  of transforming raw, messy data into a clean, organized, and reliable format that's ready for analysis. 
                  This is exactly what separates amateur work from professional-grade analysis.

                  <p className="text-green-700 text-sm mb-3">
                    Sometimes, data gets clumped together. For example, the date and time of a transaction 
                    might be in a single cell like "2023-10-15 14:30:22".
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-green-600 text-xs">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Text-to-Columns lets you easily split that one column into two 
                    separate, usable columns: one for the date and one for the time.

                    This is your data-tidying superhero. Often, exported data has extra, invisible spaces

                  <p className="text-green-600 text-xs">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> "Espresso " and "Espresso" look the same to you, but Excel sees them 
                    as two different things. TRIM fixes this automatically.
