    question: "Looking at this chart showing caf√© revenue by hour, what business decision should the manager make about staffing?",
    answers: [
      "Schedule 2 additional staff from 10 AM - 12 PM to handle the $4,200 revenue peak",
      "Reduce staff during all hours since revenue is declining after noon",
      "Keep staffing constant throughout the day regardless of revenue patterns",
      "Only schedule extra staff during the 8 AM opening hour"
    ],
    explanation: "The chart shows peak revenue of $4,200 between 10 AM - 12 PM. This high-revenue period requires adequate staffing to maintain service quality and maximize sales potential. Strategic staffing during peaks while reducing during valleys optimizes labor costs."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q2",
    question: "Sarah creates a pie chart showing that beverages represent 45% of total caf√© revenue, food 35%, and desserts 20%. What inventory strategy should this drive?",
    answers: [
      "Prioritize beverage inventory and supplier relationships since they drive nearly half of revenue",
      "Focus equally on all categories since they all contribute to revenue",
      "Eliminate desserts since they have the lowest percentage",
      "Order the same quantity of all items regardless of revenue contribution"
    ],
    explanation: "Since beverages generate 45% of revenue, they should receive priority in inventory planning, supplier negotiations, and quality control. The highest revenue contributors deserve the most attention to ensure availability and quality."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q3",
    question: "In Excel, Sarah adds a linear trendline to her scatter plot showing advertising spend vs. weekly sales. The R-squared value is 0.82. What does this tell her about the relationship?",
    answers: [
      "Strong relationship (82% of sales variation explained by advertising) - reliable for forecasting",
      "Weak relationship (only 18% correlation) - advertising doesn't affect sales",
      "Perfect relationship - advertising guarantees sales increases",
      "No relationship exists between advertising and sales"
    ],
    explanation: "R-squared of 0.82 means 82% of sales variation can be explained by advertising spend, indicating a strong relationship. Values above 0.7 are generally considered reliable for business forecasting and decision-making."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q4",
    question: "The caf√© manager looks at Sarah's line chart and says, 'I see customer traffic drops 30% at 2 PM every day. Should we close early?' How should Sarah respond using data visualization principles?",
    answers: [
      "Create additional charts showing revenue per customer and operational costs to provide complete context",
      "Agree immediately since the chart shows declining traffic",
      "Dismiss the manager's concern since one chart shows the full picture",
      "Recommend closing based solely on traffic patterns"
    ],
    explanation: "Good data visualization tells complete stories. Traffic decline alone doesn't justify closing - Sarah needs to analyze revenue per customer, fixed costs, and profitability during low-traffic periods to make informed recommendations."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q5",
    question: "Sarah builds a dashboard combining 4 charts: hourly sales, product mix, seasonal trends, and cost breakdown. What makes this more valuable than individual charts?",
    answers: [
      "Reveals connections between metrics and tells a complete business story for strategic decision-making",
      "Looks more impressive to clients but provides the same information",
      "Uses more advanced Excel features but offers no additional business value",
      "Combines unrelated data that confuses rather than clarifies business insights"
    ],
    explanation: "Dashboards reveal relationships between metrics that individual charts miss. For example, seasonal trends might explain product mix changes, while cost breakdown connects to pricing strategy. Integration creates strategic business intelligence."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q6",
    question: "When creating charts for business executives, which formatting approach demonstrates professional data visualization standards?",
    answers: [
      "Clear titles stating business insights, professional colors, minimal gridlines, and data labels only where they add value",
      "Bright colors, 3D effects, and decorative elements to make charts more visually appealing",
      "Maximum detail with every possible data label and chart element displayed",
      "Generic titles and default Excel formatting to save time"
    ],
    explanation: "Professional charts prioritize clarity and insight over decoration. Clear titles, appropriate colors, strategic use of labels, and minimal visual clutter help busy executives quickly understand and act on data insights."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q7",
    question: "Sarah discovers that her caf√© charts reveal a 15% revenue increase following weather-related advertising campaigns. What Excel feature would best help her forecast this relationship for future campaigns?",
    answers: [
      "Scatter plot with linear trendline showing campaign spend vs. revenue increase",
      "Pie chart showing proportion of revenue from different advertising types",
      "Column chart comparing campaign costs across different months",
      "Line chart showing general revenue trends over time"
    ],
    explanation: "Scatter plots with trendlines are specifically designed to show relationships between two variables (advertising spend and revenue) and provide forecasting capability through the trendline equation and R-squared value."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q8",
    question: "The caf√© wants to reduce food waste from 8% to 3%. Which combination of Excel charts would best support Sarah's waste reduction strategy?",
    answers: [
      "Line chart for daily waste trends + Column chart comparing waste by menu item + Pie chart showing waste cost breakdown",
      "Single pie chart showing current waste percentages by category",
      "Line chart showing only total monthly waste trends",
      "Column chart comparing waste to industry averages"
    ],
    explanation: "Waste reduction requires multi-dimensional analysis: trends over time (line chart), item-specific patterns (column chart), and cost impact (pie chart). This combination reveals when, what, and how much waste occurs, enabling targeted interventions."
