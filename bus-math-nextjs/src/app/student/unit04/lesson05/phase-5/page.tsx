    question: "Why do structured references make forecasts more reliable as data grows?",
    answers: [
      "They autoâ€‘expand with new rows and keep formulas current",
      "They calculate faster than regular ranges",
      "They prevent all errors permanently",
      "They color code cells automatically"
    ],
    explanation: "Tables expand automatically, so formulas like Sales[Units] always include the latest data."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a2",
    question: "Which formula creates a Promoâ€‘Adjusted regression by excluding promo days?",
    answers: [
      "FORECAST.LINEAR([@Week], FILTER(Sales[Units], Sales[PromoFlag]=0), FILTER(Sales[Week], Sales[PromoFlag]=0))",
      "FORECAST.LINEAR([@Week], Sales[Units], Sales[Week]) + 10",
      "AVERAGE(Sales[Units])",
      "SUMIF(Sales[PromoFlag], 0, Sales[Units])"
    ],
    explanation: "Filtering both Units and Week by PromoFlag=0 creates a regression on nonâ€‘promo history."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a3",
    question: "Whatâ€™s the best way to handle missing MenuID lookups in investorâ€‘facing sheets?",
    answers: [
      "Use XLOOKUP with an if_not_found default like \"Unknown\"",
      "Hide errors by changing font color to white",
      "Delete rows with missing IDs",
      "Replace formulas with static text"
    ],
    explanation: "Graceful defaults preserve output quality and highlight issues without crashing the model."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a4",
    question: "Which validation is MOST critical before presenting a forecast?",
    answers: [
      "Flag stale dates and show count of outliers in an Audit Panel",
      "Check cell background colors",
      "Bold all totals",
      "Freeze the header row"
    ],
    explanation: "Investors need to see current, clean data and that issues are known and controlled."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a5",
    question: "A scenario toggle switches Baseline vs. Promoâ€‘Adjusted. Which function is ideal?",
    answers: [
      "SWITCH or IFS on a named Scenario cell",
      "VLOOKUP with approximate match",
      "ROUNDUP",
      "TEXTSPLIT"
    ],
    explanation: "SWITCH/IFS route logic clearly based on the chosen scenario."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a6",
    question: "Which statement best describes SUMPRODUCT in this unit?",
    answers: [
      "It filters and aggregates across multiple criteria for segmented views",
      "It replaces all charting needs",
      "It turns errors into zeros",
      "It formats currencies automatically"
    ],
    explanation: "SUMPRODUCT is a flexible way to compute filtered totals (e.g., Drinks this week)."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a7",
    question: "Why add plainâ€‘language notes near inputs?",
    answers: [
      "They make assumptions visible and auditable",
      "They speed up Excel recalculation",
      "They hide complexity from teachers",
      "They enable macros to run"
    ],
    explanation: "Notes communicate assumptions and limitsâ€”crucial for trust and handoffs."
  },
  {
    id: "u04l05-a8",
    question: "Your forecast still shows #N/A. Whatâ€™s the first fix to try?",
    answers: [
      "Wrap the expression in IFERROR and check the upstream lookup",
      "Change the cell to text",
      "Delete the workbook",
      "Decrease zoom to 90%"
    ],
    explanation: "IFERROR prevents visible breaks; then trace the source (often a missing key)."
