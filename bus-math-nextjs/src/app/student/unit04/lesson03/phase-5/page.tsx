    question: "Sarah calculates that the caf√©'s weekend transactions have a mean of $8.50 and a standard deviation of $3.20. A transaction of $18.10 has what z-score?",
    answers: [
      "3.0",
      "2.5",
      "1.8", 
      "4.2"
    ],
    explanation: "z = (18.10 - 8.50) / 3.20 = 9.60 / 3.20 = 3.0. This is a significant outlier requiring investigation since z > 2."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q2",
    question: "In Excel's Analysis ToolPak, which tool generates mean, median, standard deviation, and other key statistics in one comprehensive report?",
    answers: [
      "Descriptive Statistics",
      "Regression Analysis",
      "Histogram",
      "Sampling"
    ],
    explanation: "Descriptive Statistics provides a comprehensive summary including all central tendency and variability measures that data analysts need for professional reports."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q3",
    question: "Sarah finds a $0.01 transaction in the caf√© data with a z-score of -2.8. What should she do with this outlier?",
    answers: [
      "Investigate as a likely data entry error and consider removing it",
      "Include it in analysis since all data is valuable",
      "Ignore z-scores for small amounts",
      "Change the transaction amount to match the mean"
    ],
    explanation: "A z-score of -2.8 indicates this is statistically unusual. A $0.01 transaction doesn't make business sense for any caf√© item, suggesting a data entry error that should be investigated and likely removed."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q4", 
    question: "The caf√©'s transaction data shows: Beverages (mean=$4.20), Food (mean=$9.80), Pastries (mean=$3.50). What insight can Sarah provide to management?",
    answers: [
      "Food items generate the highest average revenue per transaction and should be promoted",
      "All categories perform equally and need no changes",
      "Pastries are overpriced and should be eliminated",
      "Only beverage sales matter for profitability"
    ],
    explanation: "Food items generate more than double the revenue of other categories. Sarah should recommend promoting food items, analyzing their profit margins, and potentially expanding food offerings during peak hours."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q5",
    question: "When Sarah uses =AVERAGEIF(E:E,'Beverage',D:D) in Excel, what is she calculating?",
    answers: [
      "The average transaction amount for all beverage purchases",
      "The total number of beverage transactions", 
      "The highest beverage price in the dataset",
      "The median beverage transaction amount"
    ],
    explanation: "AVERAGEIF calculates the mean of values in column D where the corresponding value in column E equals 'Beverage'. This gives the average spending per beverage transaction."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q6",
    question: "Sarah discovers that removing outliers changes the mean from $8.50 to $7.20. What does this tell her about the outliers?",
    answers: [
      "The outliers were unusually high values that inflated the original mean", 
      "The outliers were unusually low values that reduced the original mean",
      "The outliers had no impact on central tendency",
      "The analysis is incorrect since means shouldn't change"
    ],
    explanation: "When removing outliers decreases the mean significantly, it indicates the outliers were unusually high values pulling the average upward. This is why professionals also report median, which is less affected by outliers."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q7",
    question: "A professional data consultant needs to explain outliers to a caf√© manager who isn't trained in statistics. What's the best approach?",
    answers: [
      "Use business context: 'These are transactions that don't fit typical customer patterns and need investigation'",
      "Show the z-score formula and mathematical calculations", 
      "List all statistical measures and let the manager decide",
      "Focus only on the mean and ignore outliers entirely"
    ],
    explanation: "Effective consultants translate statistical concepts into business language. Focusing on business impact and actionable insights helps non-technical stakeholders understand and act on findings."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q8",
    question: "Sarah finds that 90% of caf√© transactions fall between $2-15, but 5% are above $20. What business strategy should she recommend?",
    answers: [
      "Investigate high-value transactions to understand customer segments and create targeted promotions",
      "Remove all transactions above $20 as statistical errors",
      "Focus only on the 90% majority and ignore outliers",
      "Increase all menu prices to match the high-value transactions"
    ],
    explanation: "High-value transactions might represent catering orders, group purchases, or premium customers. Understanding these segments could lead to new revenue opportunities through targeted marketing or expanded catering services."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q9", 
    question: "In statistical analysis for business, why is standard deviation more useful than just knowing the mean?",
    answers: [
      "Standard deviation shows customer behavior variability, helping predict demand consistency",
      "Standard deviation is easier to calculate than other measures",
      "Standard deviation always equals the mean in good datasets", 
      "Standard deviation is only used for academic purposes"
    ],
    explanation: "Standard deviation reveals whether customers have consistent spending patterns (low std dev) or highly variable behavior (high std dev). This impacts inventory planning, staffing, and pricing strategies."
  },
  {
    id: "assess-q10",
    question: "Sarah's final recommendation states: 'Based on z-score analysis, we identified 3 data errors and 2 legitimate catering orders.' This demonstrates what professional skill?",
    answers: [
      "Combining statistical analysis with business judgment to make actionable recommendations",
      "Using complex formulas to impress clients with technical knowledge",
      "Applying statistics without considering business context",
      "Focusing on mathematical accuracy over practical insights"
    ],
    explanation: "The best data consultants combine statistical rigor with business understanding. Sarah's ability to distinguish between errors and legitimate business events shows professional-level analytical thinking."
