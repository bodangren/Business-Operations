### **Unit 3: The Three-Statement Storyboard**

Welcome to the next chapter of your business journey! In the last unit, you helped Sarah from TechStart Solutions conquer her month-end nightmare by building an automated system. That new efficiency freed her up to think bigger and chase more ambitious projects. But, as she quickly learned, solving one problem often reveals the next, more complex challenge waiting around the corner. Get ready to move beyond internal records and learn how to speak the official language of investors, banks, and the entire business world.

#### **1. The Day the Spreadsheet Wasn't Enough**

With her back-office operations finally running smoothly, Sarah’s confidence was at an all-time high. The automation you helped her build was working perfectly, and it gave her the time she needed to focus on growth. A huge opportunity suddenly came her way—a regional retail chain needed a massive e-commerce solution. This was the kind of project that could put TechStart Solutions on the map. But a project of that size required more resources than she had on hand. To manage it, she knew she’d need to secure a business line of credit from a bank.

Feeling prepared, Sarah walked into the bank with her clean, automated ledger from Unit 2. She knew her numbers inside and out. But after looking at her detailed spreadsheet, the loan officer said something that stopped her in her tracks: "This is nice, but where are your financial statements?". As if on cue, at almost the exact same time, her mentor introduced her to a potential investor who was interested in TechStart. His first question was the same: he wanted to see "real financial statements".

This was a huge "aha" moment for Sarah. She realized that her internal records, as accurate as they were, were for *her*. The rest of the professional world needed to see the official story of her company's health, and that story is told through three specific documents. She knew she was out of her depth, so she hired a CPA named Jennifer Kim to guide her.

Jennifer described the three financial statements as a **"storyboard" for the business**, and this idea immediately clicked for Sarah. This became the central challenge she had to solve: **How do today's journal entries flow into a narrative of profit, solvency, and cash health that investors can trust?**.

Jennifer explained that this storyboard has three parts that work together to tell one coherent story:
* **The Income Statement:** This tells the *plot* of the story. Is the business profitable?
* **The Balance Sheet:** This shows the *setting*. What does the business own versus what does it owe?
* **The Statement of Cash Flows:** This is the *action*. How is cash actually moving through the business?

Before we start building Sarah's storyboard, we’re going to do a little detective work. We’ll look at how a massive company like Tesla tells its financial story by dissecting its 10-Q, which is its official quarterly report. You’ll see how the words in their report connect to the numbers on their statements. Then, we’ll get to work turning the raw data from your Unit 1 venture into a compelling financial story of your own.

#### **2. The Plot of the Story: Building the Income Statement**

The first part of any good story is the plot. For an investor or a bank, the plot of a business is simple: is it making money? The first question Sarah had to answer for the bank was, "How do I prove that TechStart Solutions is profitable?" The answer is the **Income Statement**.

An Income Statement is a financial report that shows a company's financial performance over a specific period of time, like a month, a quarter, or a year. Think of it like a scoreboard for the business. It follows one simple, powerful formula:

$$\text{Revenues} - \text{Expenses} = \text{Net Income}$$

* **Revenues** are all the money the business earns from its sales of products or services. For Sarah, this includes the $2,200 she earned for the bakery's website.
* **Expenses** are the costs of running the business. This includes things like software subscriptions, paying contractors, and marketing costs.
* **Net Income** is the famous "bottom line." It’s the profit that’s left over after you subtract all the expenses from the revenues.

To build Sarah's Income Statement, we'll use the trial balance data from the Smart Ledger you worked on in Unit 1. But we won't just copy and paste the numbers. That’s what amateurs do. Professionals build dynamic reports. We will use a powerful Excel formula combination called `INDEX/MATCH`. Think of it as a smarter, more flexible version of VLOOKUP. By using `INDEX/MATCH` to pull data from the ledger, we create a live link. Anytime a new transaction is added to the ledger, the Income Statement will update automatically. This is how you build a financial model that is both professional and easy to maintain.

Let's start by building the "Revenue" section, pulling in all of Sarah's client project fees. Then, we'll categorize and pull in her operating expenses. The final result will be a clear, accurate calculation of her Net Income.

#### **3. Your Turn: Constructing the "Plot" for Your Venture**

You’ve seen how we organized Sarah’s revenues and expenses to find her profit—the plot of her business story. Now, it's your turn to write that first chapter for your own venture. This is your first major milestone for this unit: building a complete and accurate Income Statement from your Unit 1 trial balance data.

Your goal is to create a professionally formatted Income Statement where every number is pulled from your ledger using dynamic formulas like `INDEX/MATCH`. This is a critical skill. It ensures that your report is not just a one-time snapshot, but a living document that will always reflect the true state of your business.

As you begin, here are a few things to keep in mind:
* **Start with structure:** Lay out the main sections first: Revenue, Operating Expenses, and Net Income.
* **Categorize carefully:** Make sure every single expense from your trial balance is categorized correctly. A common mistake is to miss an expense, which can make your business look more profitable than it actually is.
* **Check your formulas:** Every formula should reference your trial balance data. There should be no hard-coded numbers in your final report.

In the business world, important documents are always reviewed by a colleague. To practice this professional habit, you and another team will swap your completed Income Statements for a peer debugging session. Using a checklist based on the milestone criteria, you will review each other’s work, checking for formula accuracy, proper categorization, and professional formatting. This is your chance to catch small mistakes before they become big problems.

#### **4. The Writer's Workshop: Refining the Story with Feedback**

A first draft is never the final draft, whether you're writing an essay or preparing a financial report for an investor. Today, you'll treat your completed Income Statement as the first draft of your financial story and present it in a "writer's workshop." Think of today's gallery walk as a session where you get fresh eyes on your work and learn from the creative solutions of your peers.

The goal here isn't to judge, but to improve. To help with this, we will use a professional feedback protocol called **"Stars and Steps"**.
* A **Star** is something that a team did exceptionally well. Maybe their formatting is incredibly clear, or they found a clever way to organize their expenses.
* A **Step** is a specific and actionable suggestion for improvement. Instead of saying "it's confusing," you might say, "A step to make this clearer would be to add a subtotal for your marketing expenses."

This process of giving and receiving structured feedback is a vital professional skill. In any company, financial reports are passed between team members, managers, and executives, with each person providing feedback to make the final product stronger. By practicing this now, you are learning how to collaborate in a way that leads to better, more accurate work. After the workshop, you will have time to incorporate the feedback you’ve received and refine your Income Statement, making it even more professional and polished.

#### **5. Taking a Breath: Reflection and Knowledge Check**

Before Jennifer Kim, Sarah’s CPA, moved on to the next financial statement, she made sure Sarah had a rock-solid understanding of the Income Statement. They paused, reviewed the work, and confirmed every detail was perfect. We're going to do the same thing today. Before we add more layers to our financial storyboard, we need to make sure our foundation is strong.

We’ll start with a team sprint retrospective. This is a chance to reflect on the process of building your Income Statement. Think about these questions together:
* **What Worked Well?** What strategies or techniques did your team use that were really effective?
* **What Was Challenging?** Where did you get stuck? What part of the process caused confusion or took longer than you expected?
* **What We Learned:** What was your team's biggest 'aha' moment during the process?

After your reflection, you'll complete a short, individual "knowledge check-up." This isn't a high-pressure test. It's a quiz designed to make sure you've mastered the key concepts of how the Income Statement is built and how it connects to the other parts of a business's finances. Nailing down these ideas now will make the next two statements much easier to build.

#### **6. The Setting of the Story: Building the Balance Sheet**

With the "plot" of her business clearly showing she could be profitable, Sarah's next task was to describe the "setting." In business, the setting is your financial position at a single moment in time. What does the company own, and what does it owe? This story is told by the **Balance Sheet**.

The Balance Sheet is governed by a familiar, fundamental law: the accounting equation.

$$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$

You already know that Assets are what the business owns (like cash and equipment), Liabilities are what it owes (like loans or bills), and Equity is the owner's stake in the company. A Balance Sheet is simply a detailed presentation of this equation.

But here is the most important part of this entire unit. The Income Statement and the Balance Sheet are not separate stories; they are two chapters of the same book, and they must be connected. The Net Income you calculated on the Income Statement doesn't just disappear—it flows directly into the Equity section of the Balance Sheet. This running total of all profits that have been reinvested back into the company is a special equity account called **Retained Earnings**.

The formula for Retained Earnings is how we link the statements:

`Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends = Ending Retained Earnings`

Today, we will perform this critical step. We will build Sarah’s Balance Sheet by pulling in her assets and liabilities from the trial balance. Then, we will take the Net Income from her Income Statement and use it in our Retained Earnings calculation. When we do this correctly, her Balance Sheet will magically balance to zero. This is the first moment of true integration, where two parts of our storyboard connect to tell a single, unified story.

#### **7. The Action of the Story: Building the Statement of Cash Flows**

Sarah's storyboard now had a plot (Income Statement) and a setting (Balance Sheet). But an investor pointed out that something was still missing: the *action*. They needed to know how cash—real, spendable money—was actually moving in and out of the business. This story is told by the final report: the **Statement of Cash Flows**.

It’s possible for a business to be "profitable" on paper but have no cash in the bank. How? Imagine Sarah completes the $2,200 bakery website project in March. Her Income Statement for March would show a profit. But what if the bakery doesn't actually pay her until April? In March, she was profitable, but she had zero cash from that job to pay her rent or her software bills. This is called a cash flow problem, and it's one of the biggest reasons why small businesses fail.

The Statement of Cash Flows solves this by tracking only the cash. We will use the **Indirect Method**, which sounds complicated but is actually quite logical. We start with the Net Income from the Income Statement, and then we make adjustments to get to the true cash story. For example, if Sarah’s clients owe her more money at the end of the month than at the beginning, that means her cash is lower than her profit, so we would make a negative adjustment.

This is the final piece of the puzzle. The Statement of Cash Flows integrates everything. The "Ending Cash" calculated on this statement must perfectly match the "Cash" asset listed on the Balance Sheet. When these two numbers match, your storyboard is complete. You have successfully created a fully integrated financial model that tells a single, trustworthy story.

#### **8. The Director's Cut: Designing a KPI Dashboard**

Sarah had finally built her three professional financial statements. She had a complete, integrated storyboard. But Jennifer, her CPA, gave her one last piece of advice: "Investors and bankers are busy. They don't always have time to read every single line item. You need to give them the highlights." A **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Dashboard** is like the movie trailer for your financial story. It's a single page that uses charts and key metrics to summarize the health and performance of the business at a glance.

This isn’t just about making pretty charts. It’s about choosing the *right* metrics that tell the most important parts of the story. For your venture, you'll need to think like an investor. What questions would they ask?
* **"Can this business pay its bills?"** The **Current Ratio** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) answers this. A ratio above 1 suggests you can.
* **"How well does this business use its assets to make a profit?"** The **Return on Assets** ratio (Net Income / Total Assets) answers this. A higher percentage is better.

Your task is to design a dashboard that brings your financial story to life. You will create charts to show trends over time, use **sparklines** for compact visualizations, and maybe even add conditional formatting to show if a KPI is meeting its target (green) or falling short (red). This dashboard will become the centerpiece of your investor presentation, turning your detailed financial data into actionable business insights.

#### **9. The Dress Rehearsal: Mock Panel & Expert Critique**

Before Sarah walked into that bank meeting, you can bet she practiced her presentation. She and Jennifer ran through the numbers, anticipated questions, and refined her story until it was perfect. Today is your dress rehearsal. You will prepare for your final "Demo Day" presentation by practicing with your peers and getting expert feedback.

Your work for today has two parts. First, you'll create an **investor one-pager**. This is a professional, single-page document that summarizes your entire financial story. It includes your mission, key findings, and a few powerful charts from your KPI dashboard. It's the ultimate leave-behind for a busy investor.

Second, you will prepare and practice your 4-minute pitch. You'll present your one-pager and demonstrate your live, interactive Excel workbook to a mock panel of your peers. Just as Sarah got feedback from her CPA, you'll get valuable critique on your presentation clarity, your technical demonstration, and the overall strength of your financial narrative. The goal today is to use this feedback to polish your presentation so that when you stand before the real investor panel, you are confident, professional, and ready.

#### **10. Demo Day: Presenting Your Story to Investors**

This is it. This is the moment you—and Sarah—have been working toward. You've transformed a pile of messy transactions from Unit 1 into a sophisticated, integrated, and self-auditing financial model. You have followed Sarah's journey from her moment of panic in front of the loan officer to the point of confidence she reached with a full set of professional statements. Today, you step into her shoes. You will present the complete financial story of your venture to a mock investor panel, which may include local CPAs, business owners, and PTA members with finance backgrounds.

Your final performance task is to deliver a compelling 4-minute pitch where you explain your business, showcase your interactive Excel workbook, and demonstrate how your model provides the insights an investor needs. You must be ready to answer questions about your financial accuracy, the story your numbers tell, and the professional quality of your work.

Remember the confidence Sarah felt when she finally had the right tools to tell her story. She got the line of credit and landed that huge retail client, which was a major turning point for TechStart Solutions. The skills you have built in this unit are the very same skills that turn ideas into investment-ready businesses.

As you prepare to present, reflect on your own journey. What was your biggest "aha" moment? When did the numbers stop being just numbers and start telling a story? You have just mastered a complex and powerful tool that is essential for any future business leader. Be proud of what you have built. Now, go tell your story.
