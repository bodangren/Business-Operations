    question: "Which validation proves the cash flow statement ties to the balance sheet?",
    answers: [
      "EndingCash = BeginningCash + NetCashFlow (within tolerance)",

    answers: [
      "SWITCH(Scenario, " + '"Base",1,"Stretch",1.1,"Conservative",0.9)' + ")",

      "Multiple copies of each formula on different sheets",

    question: "Where should audit flags live for investor confidence?",
    answers: [
      "Visible near the summary with clear labels",
      "Hidden on a helper tab",

    id: "u3a6",
    question: "Which rollup pattern is correct for COGS?",
    answers: [
      "SUMIFS(TransactionTable[Amount], TransactionTable[StatementLine], " + '"COGS"' + ")",

      "Hide the error until monthâ€‘end",
      "Round to 0 and move on",
      "Delete the outlier row"
    ],
    explanation: "Professional models never hide tie breaks; they guide fixes."
  },
  {
    id: "u3a8",
    question: "Best way to document assumptions for investors?",
    answers: [
      "A short, labeled block near KPIs with scenario notes",
