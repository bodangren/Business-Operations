      answers: [
        'The business has a net loss of $10,000 and needs to improve profitability',
        'The business is very successful and profitable',
        'The business has strong cash flow management',
        'The business has too many assets'
      ],
      explanation: 'When expenses ($95,000) exceed revenue ($85,000), the business has a net loss of $10,000. This indicates the company is not currently profitable and needs to either increase revenue or reduce expenses to achieve profitability.'

      question: 'CloudSoft Solutions has $25,000 in cash, $15,000 in equipment, and $8,000 in liabilities. What is their equity position?',

        '$32,000 in equity (Assets $40,000 - Liabilities $8,000)',
        '$25,000 in equity (just the cash amount)',
        '$17,000 in equity ($25,000 - $8,000)',
        '$48,000 in equity ($40,000 + $8,000)'
      ],
      explanation: 'Using the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), we calculate: Total Assets ($25,000 cash + $15,000 equipment = $40,000) minus Liabilities ($8,000) equals Equity ($32,000). This shows the owner\'s financial stake in the business.'

        'The business is failing and should close immediately',
        'The financial statements contain errors',
        'The business has too much inventory'
      ],
      explanation: 'This situation indicates the business is earning profit but experiencing cash flow timing problems - perhaps customers haven\'t paid their invoices yet, or the company has invested heavily in accounts receivable. This highlights why all three statements are needed for a complete picture.'

        'Just showing high revenue numbers',
        'Only demonstrating low expenses',
        'Having expensive equipment but no other information'

      question: 'Two similar businesses both show $50,000 net income. Business A has $10,000 operating cash flow while Business B has $45,000 operating cash flow. Which is financially healthier?',
      answers: [
        'Business B - higher operating cash flow indicates better cash conversion and collection',
        'Business A - lower cash flow means they reinvest more in growth',
        'They are exactly the same since net income is identical',
        'Cannot determine without more information'
      ],
      explanation: 'Business B is healthier because their operating cash flow closely matches their net income, indicating they effectively collect on sales and manage working capital. Business A may have collection issues or excessive accounts receivable.'
