                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  With her back-office operations finally running smoothly, Sarah's confidence was at an all-time high. The automation you helped her build was working perfectly, and it gave her the time she needed to focus on growth. A huge opportunity suddenly came her wayâ€”a regional retail chain needed a massive e-commerce solution. This was the kind of project that could put TechStart Solutions on the map. But a project of that size required more resources than she had on hand. To manage it, she knew she'd need to secure a business line of credit from a bank.
                </p>

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Feeling prepared, Sarah walked into the bank with her clean, automated ledger from Unit 2. She knew her numbers inside and out. But after looking at her detailed spreadsheet, the loan officer said something that stopped her in her tracks: <strong>"This is nice, but where are your financial statements?"</strong>. As if on cue, at almost the exact same time, her mentor introduced her to a potential investor who was interested in TechStart. His first question was the same: he wanted to see "real financial statements".
                </p>

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  This was a huge "aha" moment for Sarah. She realized that her internal records, as accurate as they were, were for <em>her</em>. The rest of the professional world needed to see the official story of her company's health, and that story is told through three specific documents. She knew she was out of her depth, so she hired a CPA named Jennifer Kim to guide her.

                  Before we start building Sarah's storyboard, we're going to do a little detective work. We'll look at how a massive company like Tesla tells its financial story by dissecting its 10-Q, which is its official quarterly report. You'll see how the words in their report connect to the numbers on their statements. Then, we'll get to work turning the raw data from your Unit 1 venture into a compelling financial story of your own.

                  Sarah's experience reveals a critical business reality: <strong>different audiences need information in specific formats</strong>. Her internal spreadsheets were perfect for managing day-to-day operations, but banks and investors require standardized financial statements that follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

                  This is similar to how you might write a text message to a friend versus a formal essay for English classâ€”the content might be similar, but the format and language need to match your audience's expectations. In business, financial statements are the "formal essay" format that the professional world expects.
