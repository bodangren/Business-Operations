    question: "In the Income Statement formula: Revenues - Expenses = Net Income, which represents the famous 'bottom line'?",
    answers: [
      "Net Income - this is the profit left after subtracting all expenses from revenues",
      "Revenues - this shows how much money the business earned",
      "Expenses - this shows how much money the business spent", 
      "The subtraction symbol - this shows the mathematical operation"
    ],
    explanation: "Net Income is called the 'bottom line' because it appears at the bottom of the Income Statement and represents the final profit after all expenses are deducted from revenues."
  },

    id: "intro-q2",
    question: "What is the main advantage of using INDEX/MATCH over VLOOKUP when building professional Income Statements?",
    answers: [
      "INDEX/MATCH can look in any direction and doesn't break when columns are moved, making it more flexible for complex models",
      "INDEX/MATCH is always faster than VLOOKUP in every situation",
      "INDEX/MATCH automatically formats numbers as currency",
      "INDEX/MATCH can only be used for financial statements, making it more specialized"
    ],
    explanation: "INDEX/MATCH's flexibility to look in any direction and resistance to column changes makes it the professional standard for building robust financial models that won't break when the underlying data structure changes."

    question: "When Sarah builds her Income Statement with dynamic formulas, what happens when she adds a new client transaction to her trial balance?",
    answers: [
      "The Income Statement automatically updates to include the new revenue, showing current profitability",
      "Sarah must manually update every number on the Income Statement",
      "The Income Statement deletes all previous data and starts over",
      "Nothing happens because Income Statements are static documents"
    ],
    explanation: "Dynamic formulas create 'living documents' - when new transactions are added to the trial balance, the INDEX/MATCH formulas automatically pull the updated data into the Income Statement."
  },
  {
    id: "intro-q4",
    question: "In Excel's INDEX/MATCH formula structure: =INDEX(return_array, MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, 0)), what does the '0' at the end specify?",
    answers: [
      "It specifies an exact match - the formula will only return results for perfect matches",
      "It tells the formula to start searching from the first row",
      "It formats the result as a whole number with no decimals", 
      "It makes the formula case-sensitive for text matches"
    ],
    explanation: "The '0' in MATCH specifies exact match mode, ensuring the formula only returns results when it finds a perfect match for the lookup value, which is crucial for accurate financial reporting."
  },
  {
    id: "intro-q5",
    question: "Why do investors and banks require formal Income Statements instead of just looking at Sarah's detailed ledger?",
    answers: [
      "Income Statements present the financial story in a standardized format that allows easy comparison and professional evaluation",
      "Income Statements are required by law for all businesses regardless of size",
      "Income Statements are easier to read because they use simpler language",
      "Income Statements automatically calculate taxes owed"
    ],
    explanation: "Standardized financial statements allow investors and banks to quickly evaluate a business's performance and compare it to other opportunities using familiar formats and industry-standard presentations."

              Jennifer Kim taught Sarah that the Income Statement is the "plot" of any business story because it answers 
              the fundamental question every investor asks: <strong>"Is this business profitable?"</strong> Unlike the 
              detailed transaction records in her ledger, the Income Statement presents a clean, professional narrative 
              that external stakeholders can quickly understand and evaluate.

            Professional Excel: INDEX/MATCH Mastery
          </h3>
          
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Jennifer showed Sarah why professionals use <strong>INDEX/MATCH</strong> instead of basic lookup functions. 
            This combination is more flexible and reliable for building dynamic financial models that don't break when 
            data structures change.

            <p className="text-blue-800 mb-3">
              To pull "Service Revenue" from her trial balance into the Income Statement, Sarah would write:

              =INDEX(TrialBalance[Amount], MATCH("Service Revenue", TrialBalance[Account], 0))
            </div>
            <p className="text-blue-700 text-sm">
              This formula says: "Find 'Service Revenue' in the Account column, then return the corresponding 
              Amount value." When Sarah adds new service revenue, this formula automatically updates her Income Statement.

            The difference between amateur and professional financial models is automation. When Sarah's Income Statement 
            uses dynamic formulas, her financial story stays current without manual updates.
