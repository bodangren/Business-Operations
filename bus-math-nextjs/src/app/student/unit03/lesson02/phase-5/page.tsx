    question: 'Sarah needs to show her bank that TechStart Solutions is profitable. Which financial statement tells this part of her business story?',
    answers: [
      'Income Statement - it shows whether revenues exceed expenses over a time period',
      'Balance Sheet - it shows what she owns versus what she owes',
      'Statement of Cash Flows - it shows how cash moves through the business',
      'Trial Balance - it shows all account balances'
    ],
    explanation: 'The Income Statement is the financial statement that reveals profitability by comparing revenues to expenses, making it the "plot" of the business story.'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-2',
    question: 'Why does Jennifer Kim recommend using INDEX/MATCH instead of copying and pasting numbers into the Income Statement?',
    answers: [
      'INDEX/MATCH creates dynamic formulas that automatically update when new transactions are added to the ledger',
      'INDEX/MATCH is faster to type than copying and pasting',
      'Banks require the use of complex formulas for loan approval',
      'INDEX/MATCH prevents all calculation errors'
    ],
    explanation: 'Dynamic formulas like INDEX/MATCH create live links between the trial balance and financial statements, ensuring automatic updates and maintaining data integrity.'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-3',
    question: 'If Sarah\'s Service Revenue account shows $8,500 and her total Operating Expenses are $4,200, what is her Net Income and what does this tell investors?',
    answers: [
      'Net Income is $4,300, showing the business is profitable and generating positive returns',
      'Net Income is $12,700, calculated by adding revenue and expenses',
      'Net Income cannot be determined without more information',
      'Net Income is negative, indicating the business is losing money'
    ],
    explanation: 'Net Income = Revenues - Expenses = $8,500 - $4,200 = $4,300. Positive Net Income demonstrates profitability, which is a key indicator investors look for.'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-4',
    question: 'In the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), which accounts from the trial balance flow into the Income Statement?',
    answers: [
      'Revenue and Expense accounts flow into the Income Statement to calculate Net Income',
      'Asset and Liability accounts are used to build the Income Statement',
      'Only Equity accounts appear on the Income Statement',
      'All trial balance accounts are included in the Income Statement'
    ],
    explanation: 'Only Revenue and Expense accounts from the trial balance flow into the Income Statement. Assets, Liabilities, and Equity accounts appear on the Balance Sheet.'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-5',
    question: 'What happens to Sarah\'s Income Statement if she adds a new client project worth $3,000 to her trial balance and her statements are built with INDEX/MATCH formulas?',
    answers: [
      'The Income Statement automatically updates to include the new revenue and recalculates Net Income',
      'She must manually add the $3,000 to her Income Statement',
      'The Income Statement shows an error until she rebuilds it completely',
      'Nothing changes until she updates her Excel formulas'
    ],
    explanation: 'Dynamic INDEX/MATCH formulas create live links, so when new transactions are added to the trial balance, the Income Statement automatically reflects these changes.'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-6',
    question: 'Why is it crucial for Sarah to categorize her Rent Expense correctly in the trial balance when building her Income Statement?',
    answers: [
      'Incorrect categorization could misstate her business expenses and mislead investors about her true profitability',
      'Rent is the largest expense so it matters most',
      'The bank specifically looks at rent expenses when making loan decisions',
      'Excel formulas won\'t work if categories are wrong'
    ],
    explanation: 'Proper categorization ensures accurate financial reporting. Misclassifying expenses could make the business appear more or less profitable than it actually is, misleading investors and lenders.'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-7',
    question: 'Jennifer Kim describes the three financial statements as a "storyboard." In this analogy, what specific story does the Income Statement tell?',
    answers: [
      'The plot: whether the business made or lost money during a specific period',
      'The setting: what the business owns and what it owes at a moment in time',
      'The action: how cash actually moved in and out of the business',
      'The ending: predictions about future business performance'
    ],
    explanation: 'The Income Statement tells the "plot" by revealing whether the business was profitable over a specific time period, answering the fundamental question: did the business make money?'
  },
  {
    id: 'assessment-8',
    question: 'A potential investor asks Sarah, "How do I know your business can consistently generate profit?" Which aspect of Income Statement construction best addresses this question?',
    answers: [
      'Dynamic formulas that automatically update monthly Income Statements showing consistent profitability trends',
      'A single Income Statement showing one profitable month',
      'The total amount of revenue without considering expenses',
      'A detailed list of all business assets'
    ],
    explanation: 'Consistent profitability over time is best demonstrated through a series of Income Statements that automatically update with dynamic formulas, showing sustainable profit generation rather than a one-time result.'

                when her internal spreadsheets weren't enough. After mastering Income Statement 
                construction with dynamic formulas, she returned with professional financial
