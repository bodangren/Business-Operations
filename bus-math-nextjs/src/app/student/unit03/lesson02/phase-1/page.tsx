                Sarah walked into the bank with complete confidence. Her automated ledger from Unit 2 was 
                working perfectly‚Äîevery transaction tracked, every formula calculating correctly, and her 
                month-end chaos was finally under control. This massive e-commerce project could put 
                TechStart Solutions on the map, but she needed a business line of credit to handle the 
                additional resources.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                After reviewing Sarah's detailed spreadsheet, the loan officer said something that stopped 
                her in her tracks: <strong>"This is nice, but where are your financial statements?"</strong>
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                At almost the same moment, her mentor introduced her to a potential investor who asked 
                the exact same question. Sarah realized that her internal records, as accurate as they 
                were, were for <em>her</em>. The rest of the professional world needed to see the official 
                story of her company's health through three specific documents.

                Understanding how to build professional financial statements isn't just about following 
                accounting rules‚Äîit's about speaking the language that investors, banks, and business 
                partners understand. When you can present your financial story clearly, you unlock 
                opportunities for funding, partnerships, and growth.

                Jennifer Kim, Sarah's CPA, described the three financial statements as a <strong>"storyboard"

                entries flow into a narrative of profit, solvency, and cash health that investors can trust?</strong>
