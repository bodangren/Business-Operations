                Today you've accomplished something remarkable. You started this lesson understanding 
                the frustration Sarah felt when her internal spreadsheets weren't enough for professional 
                use. Now you've mastered the same Income Statement construction skills that transformed 
                her business prospects and opened the door to major opportunities.

                More importantly, you've learned to think like a financial professional. You understand 
                that behind every number is a story, and behind every formula is a business decision 
                that can shape a company's future. This perspectiveâ€”this ability to see the human 
                impact of financial modelingâ€”is what separates true business leaders from those who 
                simply follow procedures.
