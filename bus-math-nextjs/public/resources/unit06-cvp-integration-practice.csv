# Notes:
# - Use exact-match on Scenario names (ignore rows beginning with #EDGE_ in dashboards but use them to test validation).
# - AsOfDate lets you flag stale data when older than 90 days.
# - TargetMarginPct supports executive summary (e.g., "Margin below target" alert).
# - Min/Max margin thresholds drive colored indicators on KPI cards.
