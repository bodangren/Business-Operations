# Notes:
# - Use exact-match on Scenario names for switching (ignore rows beginning with #EDGE_ in dashboards but use them to test validation).
# - AsOfDate should be recent (e.g., within 90 days) or flag as stale.
# - TargetRunwayMonths supports an executive summary (e.g., "Runway below target" alert).
# - Min/Max margin thresholds drive KPI indicator colors.
