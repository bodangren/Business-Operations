# Capstone Project Design Guidelines  
*Business Math & Finance: Applied Accounting with Excel*

---

## 1. Vision & Global Goals  

| Anchor | Guiding Goal | Success Indicators |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Authentic Integration** | Extend Semester-1 mini-projects into one investor-ready business plan and linked Excel workbook. | Three or more prior models imported; formulas traceable end-to-end; no hard-coded numbers in statements. |
| **Advanced Spreadsheet Literacy** | Demonstrate automation, validation, and scenario analysis commensurate with entry-level analyst skills. | Self-auditing dashboard; macro or button to refresh statements; Scenario Manager dashboard. |
| **Analytic Decision-Making** | Use data and sensitivity results to justify strategic choices. | Tornado chart identifies top three cash-flow drivers; narrative explains pivots. |
| **Professional Communication** | Deliver a concise, data-driven 10-slide pitch and a 3-min model-tour video. | Slides follow Problem-Solution-Market-Financials arc; model-tour clearly shows linkages. |
| **Reflection & CAP Growth** | Cultivate Courage, Adaptability, Persistence through weekly journaling and peer critique. | 150-word reflections logged weekly; peer-review checklist completed thoughtfully. |

## 4. Assessment Plan  

### 4.1 Formative (60 % course-grade category weight)

| Tool | When | Points | Criteria |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Benchmark Tasks** | Weeks 1-11 | 10 pts each | Completeness, functional formulas, on-time |
| **Peer-Review Checklists** | Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10 | 5 pts each | Accuracy of audit, constructive comments |
| **Weekly Reflection (CAP)** | Weeks 1-12 | ✓ / ½✓ / ✗ (auto-score) | Depth of insight; evidence of perseverance |

### 4.2 Summative (40 %)

| Artifact | Weight | Rubric Dimensions (pts) |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Final Business Plan & Excel Model** | 25 pts | **Model Fidelity & Automation** (10) · **Analytic Insight** (10) · **Documentation & Sourcing** (5) |
| **Investor Pitch (slides + live)** | 10 pts | **Narrative Clarity** (4) · **Data Visuals** (3) · **Timing & Delivery** (3) |
| **Model-Tour Video** | 3 pts | **Clarity of Walk-through** (2) · **Technical Sound** (1) |
| **Peer-Critique Quality** | 2 pts | Thoughtfulness, accuracy |

*Total = 40 pts summative, 60 pts formative → 100 course pts.*

## 5. Summative Rubric Details  

| Domain | Exceeds (A) | Meets (B-C) | Emerging (D) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Model Fidelity & Automation** (10) | All sheets linked; no hard-codes; macro refresh; validation dashboard clean | Statements linked; ≤ 2 manual plugs; minor validation warnings | Broken links, manual totals, or major errors |

## 6. Implementation Notes for Teachers  

* **Template Package** – Provide:  
  - “Capstone Workbook Shell” with pre-built tabs/headings  
  - Peer-review checklist (Google Form or Excel)  
  - Slide-deck master with section placeholders  

* **Skill Refreshers** – 20-min micro-lessons on Scenario Manager (Week 5) and macros (Week 8).  

* **Grading Efficiency** – Rely on validation dashboard signals and peer-review accuracy; spot-grade 30 % of formulas rather than all.
