### Unit 7: Asset & Inventory Tracker (Weeks 13–14)

#### Unit Overview

**Driving Question:**  *Which depreciation and inventory methods best align with our cash‑flow and tax strategy?*

**Entry Event (Day 1):**

* Local auditor shares a real case of a company fined for inventory misvaluation and provides anonymized asset and inventory data.

---

#### Learning Objectives

**Content Objectives:**

1. Explain and apply Straight‑Line (SLN) and Double‑Declining Balance (DDB) depreciation methods.
2. Compute Cost of Goods Sold and ending inventory using FIFO and LIFO inventory valuation.
3. Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio and analyze implications for cash management and tax planning.

**Excel/Technical Skills:**

* Build depreciation schedules using Excel’s SLN and DDB functions.
* Implement FIFO and LIFO layer calculations with array formulas.
* Create dynamic ratio calculations and visualizations (e.g., turnover ratio chart).
