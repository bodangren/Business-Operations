### Unit 8: Year‑1 Startup Model (Weeks 15–18)

### Unit Overview

**Driving Question:**  
*Can we convince a micro‑VC that our first‑year financial model is robust enough to merit funding?*

**Entry Event (Day 1):**  
A venture capitalist guest outlines common red flags in rookie startup models and challenges students to avoid them. Students review anonymized pitch decks and model failures.
