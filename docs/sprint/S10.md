# Sprint 10 – Question Bank Initiative

**Focus:** Build the reusable Unit 1 question bank, practice-test route, and lightweight spaced-repetition review experience.

## Active Issues
- [ ] **#10 – Build Unit 1 phase-5 question bank and practice-test scaffolding**  
  - Externalize lesson 01–07 phase-5 assessment items into `src/data/question-banks/unit01-phase5.ts` with lesson/objective metadata.  
  - Provide helpers for ComprehensionCheck props and random draws by lesson/tag.  
  - Refactor student phase-5 pages to consume the shared bank and balance answer lengths.  
  - Document structure in curriculum dev notes.
- [ ] **#11 – Build Unit 1 practice-test experience from question bank**  
  - Create `/student/unit01/practice-test` (six-phase styling) with question-count + lesson filters and localStorage persistence.  
  - Use bank helpers for randomized pulls, show scoring summary, add navigation hooks, and document integration pattern.
- [ ] **#12 – Prototype Unit 1 spaced-repetition review using question bank**  
  - Add `/student/unit01/review` with client-side SRS scheduler backed by localStorage.  
  - Present single-question flow with self-assessment controls, dashboard, reset/export, schema versioning, and documentation.

## Dependencies & Sequencing
1. **Issue #10** establishes the shared data layer and helper utilities. Complete before starting #11 or #12.
2. **Issue #11** consumes the bank for a practice-test UX; requires helpers from #10.
3. **Issue #12** layers persistence and scheduling on the same bank metadata; depends on #10 being stable.

## Deliverables Checklist
- Centralized Unit 1 question bank with metadata and helper functions.
- Practice-test route leveraging configurable draws from the bank.
- Lightweight spaced-repetition review route with persistent scheduling data.
- Updated developer documentation (COMPONENTS.md or MCP notes) covering question bank, practice-test, and SRS patterns.

## Testing Expectations
- `npm run lint` before each commit.  
- Manual verification of student routes: lesson phase-5 pages, `/student/unit01/practice-test`, and `/student/unit01/review`.  
- For helpers, consider lightweight scripts or storybook-like harnesses to validate draw/filter behavior.  
- Verify localStorage persistence flows (preferences, SRS scheduling) across refreshes.

## Open Questions / Notes
- Confirm final naming for practice-test navigation link targets (lesson 10 phase-6 + Unit 1 overview).  
- Align SRS scheduling approach across units once Unit 1 prototype is validated.  
- Update MCP knowledge base immediately after new components/utilities are created or modified.
