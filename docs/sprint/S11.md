# Sprint 11 – Teacher Slide Platform

**Status:** In Progress – scenario registry expansion underway for student and teacher surfaces.

## Focus
- Deliver a reusable component scenario registry for Unit 1 and extend it across Units 02-08.
- Keep teacher slide tooling, analytics, and simulations aligned with the shared data layer.
- Maintain MCP knowledge-base parity as lessons migrate.

## Completed Work
- [x] **#14 – Define Unit 1 Lesson 1 component scenarios** (PR #54)
  - Added the typed lesson/phase scenario schema at `src/types/lesson-scenarios.ts`.
  - Published the initial scenario module at `src/data/scenarios/unit01/lesson01.ts` with registry helpers.
- [x] **#15 – Refactor Unit 1 Lesson 1 student pages to consume component scenarios** (PR #55)
  - Introduced `scenario-to-props` adapters and the `ScenarioNarrative` renderer.
  - Replaced inline narrative/interactive data across all six student phase pages with scenario lookups.
- [x] **#56 – Define Unit 01 Lessons 02-04 component scenarios** (PR pending)
  - Authored lesson-specific scenario modules at `src/data/scenarios/unit01/lesson02.ts`, `lesson03.ts`, and `lesson04.ts` with complete narratives, component configs, datasets, and teacher guidance.
  - Extended the scenario registry and schema to support journal entries, transaction journals, trial balance sorting, and Excel-focused phases.
- [x] **#57 – Refactor Unit 01 Lessons 02-04 student pages to consume scenarios** (PR pending)
  - Replaced inline content across all six phases for lessons 02-04 with scenario-driven data and adapters.
  - Extended `scenario-to-props` to support journal builders, transaction journals, trial balance sorting, and T-account visualizations from the registry.
  - Ensured gradients, badges, and card layouts mirror the Lesson 01 pattern while wiring assessments to the shared question bank.

- [x] **#58 – Define Unit 01 Lessons 05-07 component scenarios** (PR pending)
  - Authored comprehensive scenario modules at `src/data/scenarios/unit01/lesson05.ts`, `lesson06.ts`, and `lesson07.ts` with narratives, component configs, datasets, and teacher notes.
  - Registered the new lessons in `src/data/scenarios/index.ts` so `getLessonScenario("unit01", lessonNumber)` resolves lessons 1-7 without runtime gaps.
  - Captured advanced automation, dashboard integration, and QA production sequences to keep student and teacher surfaces aligned.
- [x] **#60 – Define Unit 01 Lessons 08-10 component scenarios** (PR #111)
  - Authored comprehensive scenario modules for PBL milestones 1-3 at `src/data/scenarios/unit01/lesson08.ts`, `lesson09.ts`, and `lesson10.ts`.
  - Lesson 08: Project Definition with stakeholder analysis, workbook architecture, and acceptance criteria.
  - Lesson 09: Prototype + Rehearsal with testing, validation, and peer feedback integration.
  - Lesson 10: Final Presentations with authentic assessment, capstone-aligned rubrics, and reflection.
  - Updated scenario registry to export lessons 8, 9, 10, completing Unit 01 scenario coverage.

## Active Work & Backlog
- **Epic #104 – Expand scenario registry across Units 01-08** tracks the remaining 48 slices.
  - Unit 01: ✅ #56/#57/#58, #59, #60/#61
  - Unit 02: #62/#63, #64/#65, #66/#67
  - Unit 03: #68/#69, #70/#71, #72/#73
  - Unit 04: #74/#75, #76/#77, #78/#79
  - Unit 05: #80/#81, #82/#83, #84/#85
  - Unit 06: #86/#87, #88/#89, #90/#91
  - Unit 07: #92/#93, #94/#95, #96/#97
  - Unit 08: #98/#99, #100/#101, #102/#103
- Supporting initiatives still in Sprint 11:
  - #16 – Build teacher slide deck from component scenarios
  - #17 – Hydrate TeacherLessonPlan from component registry
  - #18 – Document component-driven teacher workflow
  - #19 – Refactor ErrorCheckingSystem for scenario-driven props
  - #20 – Create hook simulation registry for lesson introductions
  - #21 – Build Shoebox Challenge simulation for Unit 2 Lesson 1
  - #22 – Activate spreadsheet helper playbooks for guided practice
  - #23 – Enhance component usage dashboard with phase analytics

## Next Actions
1. Kick off **#61** (Unit 01 Lessons 08-10 student refactor) to keep registry and pages in sync.
2. Extend `scenario-to-props` and registry helpers as new component types appear in upcoming lessons.
3. Update MCP documentation immediately after each scenario migration.

## Validation Checklist
- `npm run lint`
- `tsc --noEmit`
- Chrome MCP spot checks on migrated student phases and corresponding teacher views.
- Confirm sprint docs and TODO tracker are updated as each batch ships.
