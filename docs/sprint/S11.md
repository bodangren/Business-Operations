# Sprint 11 – Teacher Slide Platform

**Status:** In Progress – scenario registry expansion underway for student and teacher surfaces.

## Focus
- Deliver a reusable component scenario registry for Unit 1 and extend it across Units 02-08.
- Keep teacher slide tooling, analytics, and simulations aligned with the shared data layer.
- Maintain MCP knowledge-base parity as lessons migrate.

## Completed Work
- [x] **#14 – Define Unit 1 Lesson 1 component scenarios** (PR #54)
  - Added the typed lesson/phase scenario schema at `src/types/lesson-scenarios.ts`.
  - Published the initial scenario module at `src/data/scenarios/unit01/lesson01.ts` with registry helpers.
- [x] **#15 – Refactor Unit 1 Lesson 1 student pages to consume component scenarios** (PR #55)
  - Introduced `scenario-to-props` adapters and the `ScenarioNarrative` renderer.
  - Replaced inline narrative/interactive data across all six student phase pages with scenario lookups.

## Active Work & Backlog
- **Epic #104 – Expand scenario registry across Units 01-08** tracks the remaining 48 slices.

- Supporting initiatives still in Sprint 11:
  - #16 – Build teacher slide deck from component scenarios
  - #17 – Hydrate TeacherLessonPlan from component registry
  - #18 – Document component-driven teacher workflow
  - #19 – Refactor ErrorCheckingSystem for scenario-driven props
  - #20 – Create hook simulation registry for lesson introductions
  - #21 – Build Shoebox Challenge simulation for Unit 2 Lesson 1
  - #22 – Activate spreadsheet helper playbooks for guided practice
  - #23 – Enhance component usage dashboard with phase analytics

## Next Actions
1. Kick off **#56/#57** (Unit 01 Lessons 02-04) following the Issue #14/#15 implementation pattern.
2. Extend `scenario-to-props` and registry helpers as new component types appear in upcoming lessons.
3. Update MCP documentation immediately after each scenario migration.

## Validation Checklist
- `npm run lint`
- `tsc --noEmit`
- Chrome MCP spot checks on migrated student phases and corresponding teacher views.
- Confirm sprint docs and TODO tracker are updated as each batch ships.
