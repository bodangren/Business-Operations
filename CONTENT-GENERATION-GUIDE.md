## Writing Standards & Voice

### Tone and Approach
- **Conversational yet Professional**: Write as if speaking directly to students, avoiding overly formal academic language
- **Encouraging and Supportive**: Acknowledge challenges while building confidence ("This might seem complex at first, but...")
- **Practical and Applied**: Always connect theory to real business applications
- **Age-Appropriate**: Remember these are Grade 12 students preparing for post-secondary or workforce entry

### Reading Level Standards
- **Target**: Eighth-grade reading level for accessibility
- **Vocabulary**: Define business terms clearly with examples
- **Sentence Structure**: Mix short and medium sentences, avoid overly complex constructions
- **Paragraph Length**: 3-5 sentences maximum for web readability

### Voice Consistency Guidelines
```
✅ GOOD: "Sarah faces a challenge that many entrepreneurs encounter..."
❌ AVOID: "The aforementioned individual must navigate complex organizational paradigms..."

✅ GOOD: "Let's build this step by step so you can see how it works."
❌ AVOID: "The subsequent procedural implementation requires systematic execution."

✅ GOOD: "Why does this matter? Because real businesses need this skill every day."
❌ AVOID: "The pedagogical significance of this concept cannot be understated."
```

### Writing Patterns for Engagement
- **Question Hooks**: Start sections with compelling questions
- **Preview Statements**: "By the end of this section, you'll be able to..."
- **Connection Bridges**: "Remember how Sarah solved X? Now she faces Y..."
- **Reality Checks**: "In the real world, this would mean..."
