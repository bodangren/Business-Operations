# Build Directory

This directory contains the output files generated by the build process for the Business Math & Finance textbook.

## Directory Structure

- `pdf/`: PDF output files
- `html/`: HTML output files

## Build Process

The build process uses Pandoc to convert the Markdown files to PDF and HTML formats. The process is automated using the Makefile in the root directory.

### Build Commands

- `make all`: Build both PDF and HTML versions
- `make pdf`: Build only the PDF version
- `make html`: Build only the HTML version
- `make clean`: Clean the build directory

## Output Files

The main output files are:

- `build/pdf/business-math-finance.pdf`: The complete textbook in PDF format
- `build/html/business-math-finance.html`: The complete textbook in HTML format

## Viewing the Output

To view the PDF output, open the PDF file with any PDF viewer.

To view the HTML output, open the HTML file with any web browser.

## Troubleshooting

If the build process fails:

1. Check the error messages in the terminal
2. Verify that Pandoc is installed correctly
3. Check that all required files are in the correct locations
4. Ensure that the Markdown files follow the styling conventions
5. Verify that the YAML frontmatter is valid

## Rebuilding

If you make changes to the content files, you need to rebuild the textbook to see the changes in the output files. Run the appropriate build command to rebuild the textbook.
