                        <h2>Why Another Business Math Textbook?</h2>
                        
                        <p>
                            If you've ever sat in a math class wondering, "When will I actually use this?", 
                            you're asking exactly the right question. Too many business mathematics textbooks 
                            treat Excel like a calculator, accounting like memorization, and entrepreneurship 
                            like theory. Students complete artificial exercises that bear little resemblance 
                            to the messy, complex, and exciting reality of running a business.
                        </p>

                            <h3>The Traditional Approach Falls Short</h3>
                            <p>
                                After teaching Business and Finance Mathematics for three years, I became 
                                increasingly frustrated with existing textbooks. They were either too 
                                theoretical (endless formulas with no context) or too simplistic 
                                (basic calculations that didn't reflect real business complexity).
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            Students would master the mechanics of creating a balance sheet but couldn't 
                            explain to their parents why it mattered. They could calculate loan payments 
                            but had no idea how to evaluate whether taking that loan was a smart business 
                            decision. Most importantly, they finished the course with no tangible evidence 
                            of their capabilities—nothing they could show to a college admissions officer 
                            or potential employer and say with confidence, "This is what I can do."

                    <section id="the-solution">
                        <h2>A Different Approach: Learn by Building</h2>
                        
                        <p>
                            This course takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of studying 
                            business, you'll <em>do</em> business. Instead of memorizing accounting 
                            principles, you'll build financial systems that real entrepreneurs would 
                            actually use. Instead of calculating hypothetical scenarios, you'll make 
                            data-driven decisions with real consequences.
                        </p>

                            <h3>Meet Sarah: Your Business Partner</h3>
                            <p>
                                Throughout this course, you'll follow Sarah Chen as she launches and grows 
                                TechStart Solutions, a technology consulting firm. Sarah's journey is based 
                                on real startup experiences—the messy cash flow problems, the sleepless 
                                nights before investor presentations, the excitement of landing that first 
                                big client.
                            </p>

                                You won't just read about Sarah's challenges; you'll solve them. Her Excel 
                                models become your Excel models. Her investor pitch becomes your investor 
                                pitch. Her success becomes your learning.

                        <p>
                            Every unit in this course centers around an authentic business challenge that 
                            entrepreneurs actually face:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li><strong>Unit 1:</strong> Design a self-auditing ledger that would convince an angel investor you keep "clean books" from day one</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 2:</strong> Create automation that cuts month-end closing time from two days to two hours without sacrificing accuracy</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 3:</strong> Build integrated financial statements that tell a compelling story to investors</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 4:</strong> Use two years of POS data to optimize inventory and staffing for maximum weekend profits</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 5:</strong> Design a payroll system that predicts cash outflows so small business owners can make rent on time</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 6:</strong> Develop pricing strategies using break-even analysis and market research</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 7:</strong> Create asset management systems that track depreciation and optimize replacement timing</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit 8:</strong> Integrate everything into a comprehensive business model ready for presentation</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>
                            Each challenge culminates in a presentation to real business professionals—
                            local entrepreneurs, CPAs, and finance experts who will evaluate your work 
                            using the same criteria they'd apply to their own businesses.

                        <p>
                            My name is Daniel Bodanske, and I've spent the last 25 years in classrooms 
                            and boardrooms. As an educator, I've seen too many bright students leave 
                            math classes convinced they "weren't good with numbers." As an entrepreneur, 
                            I've launched three companies and learned firsthand which skills actually 
                            matter when you're trying to build something from nothing.

                            <p>
                                My current company, <a href="https://reading-advantage.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reading Advantage</a>, 
                                is an AI-focused educational technology firm serving secondary students across Asia. 
                                We're currently developing Primary Advantage (grades 3-6), Tutor Advantage 
                                (small group extensive reading), and have ambitious plans for Science Advantage, 
                                Math Advantage, and STEM Advantage.

                                Every financial model you'll build in this course is based on real 
                                challenges I've faced: cash flow management, investor presentations, 
                                pricing decisions, growth planning. This isn't theory—it's practice.

                            The frustration that led to this textbook was simple: existing resources 
                            didn't prepare students for the reality of business decision-making. 
                            Students could pass tests but couldn't build actual tools. They understood 
                            concepts but couldn't communicate their value to real stakeholders.

                            The entire first semester builds toward something unprecedented in high

                                This isn't a project you'll forget after graduation. Your capstone 
                                becomes a portfolio piece—tangible evidence of your analytical thinking, 
                                technical skills, and ability to communicate complex ideas to professional 
                                audiences.

                            you're genuinely excited about. Some students will explore social enterprises 
                            addressing community problems. Others will design innovative solutions to 
                            problems they've personally experienced. A few will launch actual businesses.

                            analytical thinking, and communication skills that make you valuable
