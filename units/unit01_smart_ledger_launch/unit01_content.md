## Unit 1: Smart Ledger Launch (Weeks 1–2)

### Unit Overview  
**Driving Question:**  
How can we design a self‑auditing ledger that would convince a potential angel investor we keep “clean books” from day 1?  

**Entry Event (Day 1):**  
- Zoom Q&A with a local start‑up founder about early bookkeeping challenges  
- Founder shares three anonymized CSV “transaction dumps”  

---

### Learning Objectives  
**Content (Accounting):**  
1. Apply the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).  
2. Record debits and credits for common transactions.  
3. Generate and interpret a trial balance.  

**Skills (Excel):**  
- Create Excel Tables and structured references  
- Use SUMIF to aggregate debits/credits  
- Build conditional‑format rules (“red flags”)  
- Implement basic error‑check formulas

### Week 1: Building the Prototype Ledger

| Day | Focus | Activities | Resources | Milestone |
|----:|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Launch & Explore** | • Entry Event: Founder’s talk & dataset reveal<br>• Form teams; select a start‑up (food truck, e‑commerce, tutoring) or pitch your own | • Transaction CSVs<br>• “Choosing Your Venture” handout | — |
| 2 | **Accounting Equation & Excel Tables** | • Mini‑lesson: Accounting equation & T‑accounts<br>• Demo: Convert raw CSV to Excel Table<br>• Hands‑on: Format table, add headers | • Sample ledger template (Excel) | — |
| 3 | **Journal Entries Practice** | • Guided practice: Record 10 sample transactions<br>• Peer‑quiz: Exchange ledgers & identify errors | • Journal‑entry worksheet | Milestone ①: Prototype ledger with 10 transactions |
| 4 | **SUMIF & Auto‑Totals** | • Teach: SUMIF to total debits/credits by account<br>• Lab: Implement SUMIF in your ledger; test on sample data | • SUMIF formula cheat‑sheet | — |
| 5 | **Sprint Retrospective** | • Team reflection: What worked? What blocked you?<br>• Teacher & peer feedback on prototype | • Retrospective protocol sheet | — |

### Week 2: Adding Self‑Audit & Pitch Prep

| Day | Focus | Activities | Resources | Milestone |
|----:|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 6 | **Conditional‑Format “Red Flags”** | • Demo: Highlight negative balances, missing entries<br>• Lab: Build three “red‑flag” rules (e.g., debit ≠ credit) | • Conditional formatting guide | Milestone ②: Integrated “red‑flag” rules |
| 7 | **Trial‑Balance Auto‑Check** | • Teach: Trial balance logic; write check formula (`ABS(sum_debits–sum_credits)=0`)<br>• Lab & test on full dataset | • Trial‑balance formula snippet | Milestone ③: Trial balance auto‑check passes 100% |
| 8 | **Pitch Workshop** | • Structure: 4‑min pitch + live demo<br>• Students storyboard key points; rehearse in teams | • Pitch storyboard template | — |
| 9 | **Panel Rehearsal & Revision** | • Mock panel (peers + teacher) Q&A<br>• Revise workbook & slide deck based on feedback | • Peer‑feedback form | — |
| 10 | **Public Presentation** | • 4‑min pitch video + live demo to PTA panel<br>• Collect panel feedback for final reflection | • Recording setup guide | Final deliverable |

### Assessment Evidence & Rubric  

| Criteria                   | Weight | Exemplar Indicators                                  |
|----------------------------|:------:|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**               | 45%    | All transactions correctly posted; balances reconcile |
| **Functionality**          | 25%    | SUMIF and trial‑balance checks work on full dataset   |
| **User Documentation**     | 15%    | Clear instructions, comments, and labeled sections    |
| **Pitch Clarity & Persuasion** | 15% | Engaging narrative; addresses investor concerns       |

---

### Resources & Templates  
- **Excel Starter Workbook:** Pre‑built Table, sample transactions, formula placeholders  
- **Cheat‑Sheets:** SUMIF, conditional formatting, trial‑balance formula  
- **Feedback Forms:** Peer‑review and panel‑review rubrics  
- **Pitch Storyboard Template**  

---

### Differentiation & Supports  
- **Scaffolded formulas:** Provide partial SUMIF syntax for students needing support  
- **Extension:** Challenge advanced students to build dynamic dropdowns for account selection  
- **Peer Tutoring:** Pair students strong in Excel with those needing extra help  

---

### Public Product & Audience  
- **Deliverable:** 4‑minute video pitch + live Excel workbook demo  
- **Audience:** PTA members with finance backgrounds; feedback used for iteration

### Next Steps after Unit 1  
- Archive final ledgers in digital portfolio  
- Teams write a 1‑page reflection: “How our self‑audit ledger builds investor trust”  
- Prepare transition to Unit 2’s month‑end automation challenge
