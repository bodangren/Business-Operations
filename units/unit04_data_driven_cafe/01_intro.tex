% Update: Unit 4 intro section for Data-Driven Café

\section{Introduction}
\begin{Replace}
Don't Use: Raw graphs from Excel before students understand z-scores or regression visuals
\end{Replace}

\begin{Trivia}
Analyzing just two weekends of sales data helped one real café cut pastry waste by 37\%.
\end{Trivia}

In this two-week mini-project, your team will act as analytics consultants for a local café struggling with overstock and understaffing. Starting from two years of real (anonymized) weekend point-of-sale (POS) data, you will:

\begin{skillbox}{Key Knowledge \& Skills}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Clean and validate raw CSV data for analysis
  \item Apply descriptive statistics and z-scores to identify demand patterns
  \item Use Excel's Analysis ToolPak to build histograms and regression forecasts
  \item Recommend staffing and inventory plans backed by simulated cost savings
\end{itemize}
\end{skillbox}

\begin{Important}
\textbf{Driving Question:} Given two years of POS data, what inventory and staffing plan will maximize weekend profits without raising waste above 3\%?
\end{Important}

%TODO: Link to Excel POS dataset, z-score handout, Analysis ToolPak tutorial, and infographic pitch template.
