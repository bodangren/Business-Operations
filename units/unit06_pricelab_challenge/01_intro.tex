In this two-week mini-project, teams will take on the role of pricing analysts for a new venture entering a competitive market. Using scraped competitor data and Excel scenario tools, your goal is to recommend a pricing strategy that meets your profit target—without pricing yourself out of the market. You'll benchmark current competitors, model your own cost-volume-profit (CVP) scenarios, and prepare for a town-hall debate judged by a real audience.
