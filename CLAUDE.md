## Project Overview

"Math for Business Operations" is an interactive textbook for Grade 12 business mathematics that has evolved from a LaTeX-based project to a modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript platform. The textbook integrates accounting principles, spreadsheet modeling, and entrepreneurship through comprehensive interactive components.

**Current Status**: The project has been fully migrated from LaTeX to HTML with advanced interactive features including spreadsheet simulators, financial calculators, data visualizations, drag-and-drop exercises, business simulations, and a complete gamification system. **Link integrity management system implemented** with automated dead link detection and todo integration.

### Testing Interactive Components
```bash
# Use comprehensive debug test suite for all component testing
cd html/debug/
python -m http.server 8000

# Available test pages:
# - spreadsheet-test.html     (All spreadsheet presets and formulas)

## Content Development Guidelines

### Using Interactive Components
- **Always reference INTERACTIVE-COMPONENTS.md** for implementation details
- Include appropriate JavaScript files in correct order
- Use semantic HTML with proper data attributes
- Follow established naming conventions for consistency

### Component-First Development Workflow
**CRITICAL: All interactive components must be tested before lesson creation**

#### Pre-Development Testing Requirements
1. **Test Existing Components First**: Before creating any new interactive activity, check if existing tested components can meet the learning objective
2. **Use Debug Test Pages**: All components have comprehensive test pages in `html/debug/` that must be used for validation
3. **Component Selection Priority**:
   - ✅ **First Choice**: Use existing tested components (spreadsheet, calculator, drag-drop, simulation, gamification)
   - ⚠️ **Second Choice**: Modify existing component with new presets or configurations
   - ❌ **Last Resort**: Create entirely new component type (requires full testing suite addition)

#### New Component Type Protocol
When creating a completely new component type:
1. **Add to appropriate debug test page** (or create new test page if needed)
2. **Run comprehensive testing** using the debug interface
3. **Document in INTERACTIVE-COMPONENTS.md** with usage examples
4. **Update UNIT-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md** with new component requirements
5. **Only then create lessons** using the thoroughly tested component

#### Quality Gates
- 🔒 **Gate 1**: Component functionality verified in debug environment
- 🔒 **Gate 2**: Integration with gamification system confirmed
- 🔒 **Gate 3**: Mobile responsiveness and accessibility validated
- 🔒 **Gate 4**: Performance metrics meet standards (<3s load, <500ms interaction)
- ✅ **Gate 5**: Ready for lesson integration

**Remember: Component testing is not optional. The debug test suite exists to prevent bugs in student-facing content.**

### Unit Development Pattern
1. **Start with concepts.html** - Establish theoretical foundation
2. **Add interactive spreadsheet** - Practice with realistic scenarios  
3. **Include financial calculators** - Apply calculations to real problems
4. **Implement drag-drop exercises** - Reinforce through kinesthetic learning
5. **Add business simulation** - Synthesize knowledge in realistic context
6. **Create comprehensive assessment** - Validate learning objectives

### Content Standards
- All interactive components automatically integrate with gamification
- Use established callout box types for consistency
- Include comprehension checks after major concepts
- Provide multiple learning modalities for different learning styles
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all content

### Integration with Existing Content
- Migrate LaTeX content by converting environments to HTML/CSS equivalents
- Replace static Excel tables with interactive spreadsheet simulators
- Convert mathematical examples to interactive calculators
- Transform exercises into drag-and-drop or simulation activities

## Link Integrity & Quality Assurance

### Dead Link Detection System
A comprehensive system for maintaining link integrity across the website:

**Tools:**
- `check-links.py` - Python script that scans all HTML files for broken internal links
- Custom commands: `/check-links` and `/update-link-todos` for ongoing maintenance
- Automated todo integration for systematic link fixing

**Usage Pattern:**
1. Run `python3 check-links.py --html-root html --format summary` before major commits
2. Use `/update-link-todos` to convert broken link findings into actionable TodoWrite tasks
3. Prioritize fixes: Navigation links (high) → Content links (medium) → Resources (low)

**Current Status (as of last session):**
- **326 total links** across 14 HTML files
- **120 broken internal links** (60.9% success rate)
- **Recently fixed**: favicon.png, frontmatter/preface.html (6 links fixed)

### Priority Missing Content
Based on link analysis, these files are most critical to create:

**High Priority (Navigation):**
- Unit index files: `units/unit0[2-8]-*/index.html` (7 files)
- `frontmatter/acknowledgments.html`
- `capstone/index.html`
- `backmatter/glossary.html`
- `search.html`

**Medium Priority (Content):**
- Unit 1 completion: `exercises.html`, `summary.html`
- Teacher overview files: `pbl-methodology.html`, `semester-overview.html`, `assessment-philosophy.html`
