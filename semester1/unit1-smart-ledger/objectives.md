# Learning Objectives: Smart Ledger Launch

This document outlines the specific learning objectives for Unit 1: Smart Ledger Launch. By the end of this two-week unit, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of these objectives through their self-auditing ledger project and investor pitch.

## Content Objectives (Accounting)

### 1. Apply the Accounting Equation

Students will be able to:
- Explain the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) and its significance
- Identify and categorize business transactions as assets, liabilities, or equity
- Demonstrate how the accounting equation remains in balance after each transaction
- Analyze how business events affect the components of the accounting equation

**Assessment**: Students correctly classify accounts and maintain a balanced accounting equation in their ledger project.

### 2. Record Debits and Credits for Common Transactions

Students will be able to:
- Explain the rules of debits and credits for different account types
- Record common business transactions using proper debit and credit entries
- Identify which accounts are affected by various business events
- Create accurate journal entries with equal debits and credits
- Trace the flow of transactions through the accounting system

**Assessment**: Students correctly record all 10 required transactions in their ledger with proper debits and credits.

### 3. Generate and Interpret a Trial Balance

Students will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and importance of a trial balance
- Create a trial balance from ledger accounts
- Verify that total debits equal total credits
- Identify and correct common errors revealed by a trial balance
- Use the trial balance as a basis for financial statement preparation

**Assessment**: Students generate an accurate trial balance that proves their ledger is in balance.

## Skill Objectives (Excel)

### 1. Create Excel Tables and Structured References

Students will be able to:
- Convert raw data into a properly formatted Excel Table
- Use structured references in formulas (e.g., [@Column], Table[Column])
- Apply appropriate formatting to enhance readability and professionalism
- Utilize Table features such as filtering, sorting, and automatic expansion
- Create calculated columns within Tables

**Assessment**: Students' ledger uses properly formatted Excel Tables with appropriate structured references.

### 2. Use SUMIF to Aggregate Debits/Credits

Students will be able to:
- Explain the syntax and purpose of the SUMIF function
- Implement SUMIF to calculate account balances
- Create summary tables using SUMIF to aggregate transactions by account
- Combine SUMIF with other functions for more complex calculations
- Troubleshoot common SUMIF errors

**Assessment**: Students implement working SUMIF formulas that correctly calculate account balances.

### 3. Build Conditional-Format Rules ("Red Flags")

Students will be able to:
- Create conditional formatting rules based on cell values
- Implement formula-based conditional formatting
- Design visual indicators that highlight potential errors or issues
- Apply multiple conditional formatting rules to the same range
- Create a hierarchy of alerts with different formatting for different severity levels

**Assessment**: Students implement at least three working "red flag" rules that identify potential errors.

### 4. Implement Basic Error-Check Formulas

Students will be able to:
- Create formulas that verify data integrity
- Implement checks for balanced debits and credits
- Design formulas that validate the accounting equation
- Create user-friendly error messages
- Build a comprehensive error-checking dashboard

**Assessment**: Students implement working error-check formulas that accurately identify whether the ledger is balanced.

## Professional Skills Objectives

### 1. Financial Documentation

Students will be able to:
- Create clear, concise transaction descriptions
- Implement consistent naming conventions for accounts
- Document formulas and calculations with appropriate cell comments
- Organize worksheets with labeled sections and clear structure
- Create user guides or instructions for using the ledger

**Assessment**: Students' ledger includes clear documentation, consistent naming, and organized structure.

### 2. Presentation and Communication

Students will be able to:
- Explain complex accounting concepts in simple terms
- Create a compelling narrative about financial transparency
- Design and deliver a professional 4-minute pitch
- Demonstrate technical features through a live Excel demo
- Respond effectively to questions from the investor panel

**Assessment**: Students deliver a clear, persuasive pitch that effectively communicates the value of their self-auditing ledger.

### 3. Collaboration and Teamwork

Students will be able to:
- Contribute effectively to a team project
- Fulfill assigned roles and responsibilities
- Provide constructive feedback to peers
- Incorporate feedback to improve work
- Reflect on team dynamics and personal contributions

**Assessment**: Students participate actively in team activities and contribute to the final project.
