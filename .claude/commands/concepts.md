Generate a Concepts section using comprehensive context and established interactive theory exploration patterns.

Usage: /concepts unit[XX]

Example: /concepts unit02

Context Loading Process:
1. **REQUIRED**: Read these files before generating content:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and development guidelines
   - `UNIT-DEVELOPMENT-FRAMEWORK.md` - Content development standards
   - `INTERACTIVE-COMPONENTS.md` - Component specifications and API usage
   - `UNIT-DEVELOPMENT-CHECKLIST.md` - Quality assurance requirements
   - `html/units/unit01-smart-ledger/concepts.html` - Reference implementation pattern

2. **Unit Content**: Extract from matching content file:
   - Core accounting/business concepts to teach (4-6 progressive sections)
   - Mathematical relationships and formulas with business context
   - Real-world applications and authentic examples
   - Common misconceptions and error prevention strategies

3. **Content Structure**: Create progressive concept building:
   - Start with foundational definitions using Definition callouts
   - Build to mathematical relationships with Example callouts
   - Apply to business scenarios with real TechStart data
   - Include Warning callouts for common pitfalls
   - Use Tip callouts for professional best practices

4. **Interactive Theory Exploration**:
   - Concept explorers with sliders and real-time calculations
   - Interactive categorization exercises for key terms
   - Step-by-step guided discovery activities
   - Real-time feedback systems with detailed explanations
   - Progressive disclosure of complex concepts

5. **Sarah Narrative Integration**:
   - Use TechStart's business progression for all examples
   - Apply unit concepts to Sarah's current business challenges
   - Show realistic data and business situations
   - Connect theory to practical business decision-making

6. **Framework Compliance**:
   - 60-90 minute estimated duration
   - Eighth-grade reading level with business vocabulary support
   - 4-6 concept sections with logical progression
   - Comprehension check (3-4 questions) with explanatory feedback
   - Accessibility features and mobile responsiveness

7. **Interactive Component Integration**:
   - Spreadsheet simulator demonstrations (basic interactions)
   - Custom concept explorers with JavaScript validation
   - Gamification integration (25 points per section, 75+ total)
   - Progress tracking and mastery indicators
   - Error handling and loading states

8. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Validate all formulas and calculations
   - Test interactive elements for proper functionality
   - Ensure callout boxes have meaningful, relevant content
   - Verify comprehension check covers all major concepts
   - Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation

9. Generate file: `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/concepts.html`

This command creates engaging theoretical foundations that build understanding through interactive exploration while maintaining Sarah's authentic business context throughout.
