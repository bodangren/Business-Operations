9. **Generate Complete File Structure**:
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/index.html` (unit overview with navigation)
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/intro.html` (entry event and objectives)
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/concepts.html` (interactive theory building)
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/excel-model.html` (hands-on skill development)
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/examples.html` (progressive demonstrations)
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/exercises.html` (multi-modal practice)
   - `html/units/unit[XX]-[slug]/summary.html` (consolidation and reflection)

10. **Curriculum Continuity Management**:
