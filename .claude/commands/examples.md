Generate an Examples section using comprehensive context and 4-tier complexity demonstration patterns.

Usage: /examples unit[XX]

Example: /examples unit02

Context Loading Process:
1. **REQUIRED**: Read these files before generating content:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and development guidelines
   - `UNIT-DEVELOPMENT-FRAMEWORK.md` - Development standards and complexity tiers
   - `INTERACTIVE-COMPONENTS.md` - Component specifications and API usage
   - `UNIT-DEVELOPMENT-CHECKLIST.md` - Quality assurance requirements
   - `html/units/unit01-smart-ledger/examples.html` - Reference implementation pattern

2. **Unit Content**: Extract from matching content file:
   - Real-world business scenarios for examples
   - Specific transactions and calculations to demonstrate
   - Learning objectives to reinforce through examples
   - Common errors and troubleshooting scenarios

3. **4-Tier Complexity Structure**:
   - **Example 1 (Basic)**: Simple scenario with step-by-step walkthrough
   - **Example 2 (Intermediate)**: More complex with multiple steps and calculations
   - **Example 3 (Advanced)**: Real-world complexity with error detection
   - **Example 4 (Professional)**: Full business scenario with decision-making

4. **Sarah Business Context**:
   - Use TechStart Solutions progression throughout all examples
   - Apply unit-specific challenges to authentic business scenarios
   - Show realistic financial data and business decisions
   - Connect examples to investor presentation preparation
   - Maintain narrative continuity from previous sections

5. **Interactive Demonstration Features**:
   - Step-by-step walkthroughs with pause/replay controls
   - Interactive transaction entry with validation
   - Error detection and correction demonstrations
   - Real-time calculation updates and balance checking
   - "Try it yourself" practice sections after each example

6. **Framework Compliance**:
   - 60-75 minute estimated duration
   - Progressive complexity building confidence
   - Multiple learning modalities (visual, kinesthetic, analytical)
   - Assessment evidence collection throughout
   - Accessibility features and mobile responsiveness

7. **Interactive Component Integration**:
   - Multiple spreadsheet simulators with proper API integration
   - Financial calculators (NPV, loan, break-even as appropriate)
   - Data visualization charts showing example results
   - Interactive practice with progressive hint system
   - Gamification integration (20 points per example, 80+ total)

8. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Validate all calculations and formulas in examples
   - Test interactive elements for proper functionality
   - Ensure examples build logically in complexity
   - Verify hint systems provide meaningful guidance
   - Test real-time feedback and validation systems

9. **JavaScript Implementation**:
   - Example demonstration controls with step-by-step progression
   - Interactive practice management with transaction selection
   - Progress tracking and mastery validation systems
   - Real-time feedback and error detection
   - Integration with gamification and achievement systems
