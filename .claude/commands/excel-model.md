Example: /excel-model unit02

Context Loading Process:
1. **REQUIRED**: Read these files before generating content:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and development guidelines
   - `UNIT-DEVELOPMENT-FRAMEWORK.md` - Development standards and preset mapping
   - `INTERACTIVE-COMPONENTS.md` - Spreadsheet simulator API and integration patterns
   - `UNIT-DEVELOPMENT-CHECKLIST.md` - Quality assurance requirements
   - `html/units/unit01-smart-ledger/excel-model.html` - Reference implementation pattern

2. **Unit Content**: Extract from matching content file:
   - Specific Excel skills to teach (formulas, functions, techniques)
   - Model type to build (ledger, calculator, dashboard, analysis tool)
   - Business scenario and realistic data context
   - Professional formatting and validation requirements

3. **Progressive Building Structure** (5 structured steps):

   - **Step 4**: Professional formatting and conditional highlighting
   - **Step 5**: Validation, testing, and real-world scenario application

4. **Spreadsheet Simulator Integration**:
   - Use appropriate preset per unit type:
     * Unit 1 (Ledger): `data-preset="ledger"` 
     * Unit 2 (Automation): `data-preset="basic"`
     * Unit 3 (Statements): `data-preset="calculator"`
     * Unit 4+ (Analysis): Custom presets as needed
   - Multiple simulator instances for step-by-step building
   - Proper API usage: setData(), getData(), setFormula() methods
   - Loading state management and error handling

5. **Sarah Business Context**:
